<p class="center">THEIR WEDDING MORNING.</p>


<p>Ivan pulled aside the curtain and looked up at the sky.
It was as clear as crystal, as blue as the eyes of his beloved,
the promise fulfilled of a perfect day. On a window
cornice across the street a tiny bird perked his head
toward the sun and chirped noisily. To a lively imagination
kindled by fond anticipations the twittering of the
bird would have seemed like music. So it was to Ivan.
His heart responded with unformed melodies, and some
of their stray notes found their way humming to his
throat as he hastened his toilet.</p>

<p>A long process it was in spite of his haste. Every outer
garment, though but yesterday brought by the tailor,
had to be brushed with exquisite care, and when it came
to adjusting his tie, what with finding in the light of
this beautiful morning that not one of the numerous assortment
seemed to be bright enough for the occasion,
and having rejected all in turn, and having selected one
at last that might be made to do, and having found the
knot and loosed it&mdash;well, time had passed, and under ordinary
circumstances patience might have gone with it. Ordinary,
the circumstances were not, and if they had been
I presume any tie could have, and would have been
thrown together in a shape not less pleasing than that
which finally caused him to turn from the mirror in cheerful
despair and ring for breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. White was prompt in responding to the summons,
for she had been expecting it with quivering anxiety for
the last half hour. Good soul! With eggs at thirty-five
cents a dozen she nevertheless plunged two in hot water
every four minutes, in order that her lodger might not
trace the slightest sense of disappointment, on this eventful
day, to her.</p>

<p>"I do hope his last breakfast here will be a pleasant
one," she said when her daughter protested against the
extravagance.</p>

<p>There was certainly nothing in the plain breakfast to
call for criticism. Ivan might not have noticed it if there
had been, for his thoughts were elsewhere, and his emotions
were stirred by causes at once more delicate and
more powerful than appetite; but Mrs. White was probably
in the right. It would have been a pity to permit
any chance of a jarring note however slight in the harmony
that pervaded his being.</p>

<p>Ivan greeted his landlady gayly, and attacked his meal
as if there were no such thing as love in the world, love
that makes man melancholy, that destroys the delights of
good living, that drives him to the production of gloomy
wails in more or less eccentric verse. There was no such
love for him. Out of the storm and stress of an eventful
career, in which misfortune had rained its blows upon
him with undue severity, love had arisen like the comforting
glow of a home hearth fire, and it shone upon his
exile with naught in its beams but serenity and peace.
Ivan was happy.</p>

<p>Breakfast was hardly begun when Mrs. White again appeared.</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman to see you, Mr. Strobel," she said
hesitatingly; "I didn't like to disturb you, but he seemed
very anxious, and so I said I would see if you were at
home."</p>

<p>She laid a card upon the breakfast table and waited.</p>

<p>Ivan glanced at it and frowned. So, there must needs
be a cloud upon this day to remind him, as if he needed it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
how surely the sun of happiness was shining for him. Alexander
Poubalov! What could he be doing in America,
and what could have led him to call at just this juncture?
Bah! there could be no significance in it, nothing but a
memory of troublous experiences could be evoked by his
presence, nothing connected with that past could possibly
intervene now between him and the new life upon which
he was joyously entering.</p>

<p>Mrs. White was sorely distressed, for she saw that her
lodger was disturbed, and in her motherly heart she
wished that she had told the stranger below one of those
white lies that have come to be regarded as not sinful in
that they effect at least a postponement of evil. She
might have said that Mr. Strobel was engaged, or that he
had given up his room a week before. Both statements
would have been true enough for the Recording Angel's
book, goodness knows!</p>

<p>"If you had only just gone, or if he had come an hour
later," she murmured plaintively.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's nothing the matter," cried Ivan, lightly;
"I was simply wondering what in the world he could want
with me. I haven't seen him for five years. Show him
up, please."</p>

<p>Not half satisfied that nothing was the matter, Mrs.
White obeyed, and presently Alexander Poubalov stood
upon the threshold. He was a distinguished-looking man,
tall, swarthy, middle-aged, a remarkable contrast to his
fair-haired fellow countryman, Ivan Strobel.</p>

<p>"I am indeed glad to see you, Strobel," he said, his
deep tones vibrant as a church bell; "may I come in?"</p>

<p>"I received your card and I sent for you," replied Ivan,
coldly. He had risen and was standing by the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>"I shall be sorry if I have disturbed you, for I had no
such purpose in calling upon you. Pray go on with your
breakfast," and Poubalov took a step or two forward, as if
waiting for an invitation to sit down.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>"To what purpose, then, may I attribute your call?"
asked Ivan, without stirring.</p>

<p>"You are in haste, my friend," replied Poubalov, smiling;
"you have probably learned the American habit of
putting business ahead of all other things; but I see, too,
that there may be some especial reason to-day for hurry.
You are dressed to go out, and you have packed your
trunks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is quite like you," interrupted Ivan, "to note every
detail and attach some significance of your own to it. You
are right, however, on this occasion. Time is precious
with me to-day. I am to be married at noon."</p>

<p>"Ah! married! Strobel," and Poubalov made as if he
would extend his hand, "I wish you would permit me to
congratulate you."</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary," responded Ivan, remaining like a
statue by his chair.</p>

<p>Poubalov shrugged his shoulders and looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"As you will," he said, "and perhaps it would be as
well to postpone my call, as it seems you regard it as an
unhappy intrusion."</p>

<p>"If you have any business other than that attending to
a spy in general," said Ivan, "I shall be pleased if you
will dispatch it now. If, on the contrary, you still have
any interest in my movements, I will give you my itinerary,
and you can follow me if you like. I will only suggest
that we are not in Russia, and that it is not my intention
to go outside the jurisdiction of the United
States."</p>

<p>"You need only tell me, if you have no objection," replied
Poubalov, "where I may look for you some time
after your wedding journey."</p>

<p>Ivan picked up Poubalov's card and wrote an address
upon it. "I shall live there," he said, handing the card to
his caller. "I expect to return in two weeks."</p>

<p>Poubalov read the card and thoughtfully placed it in his
pocketbook. "If I knew how to, Strobel," he remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
gravely, "I would assure you that you need have no
anxiety on my account during your honeymoon, or afterward;
but I see clearly that now, as heretofore, you will
place no reliance whatever upon my words, and that you
discredit my motives."</p>

<p>"You speak truly," said Ivan; "but we will not discuss
the reasons for my distrust. You know them even better
than I do. You may spare yourself any words. I shall not
be disturbed by anxiety."</p>

<p>"On another occasion, then, I may hope for a somewhat
extended conversation. Good-morning. My good wishes
would doubtless be repugnant to you."</p>

<p>Ivan bowed silently and Poubalov withdrew.</p>

<p>"Strange that I should be pursued after all this lapse of
time, and to this far country," thought Ivan; "but I have
done right. I have nothing to fear from Poubalov or the
government whose paid spy he is."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch, and, resuming his place at the
table, hastily swallowed a cup of coffee. Mrs. White's
eggs remained unbroken.</p>

<p>A carriage was waiting for him at the door and it was
time that he should go, for the wedding was to take place
at Rev. Dr. Merrill's little church in Roxbury, four miles
away. With moderate driving and no accident he would
be there in time to meet the bridal party at the door. A
happy farewell to his landlady and her daughter, and he
was off.</p>

<p>He did not notice that as his coupé turned into Somerset
Street from Ashburton Place, a closed carriage left its
position not far from Mrs. White's door and followed. If
he had observed it he would have thought nothing of it,
for in Boston other persons besides bridegrooms employ
public conveyances, and it is not always that a cabman is
employed to drive a fare to a wedding.</p>

<p>Ivan's coupé rolled gently down Park Street, and just
as it reached the corner of Tremont, one of the forward
wheels came off. The passenger was precipitated forward,
and the driver with difficulty kept his seat. He climbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
down in a moment, angry and bewildered. He could discover
no break about his vehicle, but there was the wheel
upon the ground, there was the body leaning forward,
straining upon the shafts, disconcerting the horse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Open the door!" cried Ivan, imperatively; "I can't be
shut up here!"</p>

<p>The driver got the door open after a little trouble and
Ivan crawled out.</p>

<p>"I don't see how it happened," began the driver.</p>

<p>"No matter. It can't be helped in a minute, can it? I
must have another conveyance."</p>

<p>A crowd was quickly gathering, and as Ivan looked
around him he caught the eye of the driver of the closed
carriage.</p>

<p>"Are you engaged?" called Ivan. Then, as the driver
signified his willingness to take a fare, Ivan recoiled. The
carriage looked as if it were on the way to a funeral. He
hated presentiments and despised himself for the momentary
feeling of discomfort.</p>

<p>"You can pull down the curtains, sir, after you get in,"
said the driver as if he had noticed his prospective passenger's
discomfort. "Where to, sir?" he continued with his
hand on the door.</p>

<p>Ivan told him and with a "Hurry, please," bolted into
the carriage.</p>

<p>The driver sprang to his seat as if his salvation depended
on his speed, lashed his horse heavily, and the
carriage fairly leaped through the crowd and down Tremont
Street. It was a beautiful June morning and the
passenger was on his way to his own wedding, but he did
not lower the curtains of the gloomy carriage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A gentle quiver of excitement stirred the congregation
that filled the little vine-covered church on Parker Avenue
as the clock tolled the noon hour and the organist began
to play softly, his fingers weaving scraps of melody
into a vague but pleasing harmony like the light that filtered
through the stained glass windows. This was but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the suggestion of a coming outburst of harmony, for presently,
as the joyful procession would be ready to move,
he would open all the gates of sound and flood the edifice
with the triumphal strains of the Wedding March, strains
that seem light and music, too, to all listeners and beholders.
Within the vestibule the bridal party awaited the
coming of the groom. There, too, were Ivan's two friends,
to do him honor by marching with him; one a Russian
like himself, the other an American. With smiling faces
they all endeavored to conceal annoyance that was
speedily turning to anxiety over Ivan's delay.</p>

<p>Clara Hilman, as lovely a bride as ever donned the
orange-decked veil, stood with palpitating heart beside
her uncle and guardian, Matthew Pembroke. With awkward
words he was trying to soothe what he felt must be
her fears. All about them were pretty children dressed to
follow the bride, and Clara's dearest girl friends. Within
the chancel Dr. Merrill waited, wondering a little, but
not permitting himself to attach hasty blame to anybody
for this embarrassing hitch in the proceedings. The organist
looked inquiringly at the group that had found
places in the choir loft and they returned his gaze by
shakes of the head.</p>

<p>"You are more nervous than I am, uncle," said Clara
with an attempt at bravery, though her trembling lips
betrayed her; "he will be here."</p>

<p>"There he is!" cried Ralph Harmon, one of Ivan's
friends, as a carriage was seen to turn into the avenue
from a street a little way off, and come hurrying toward
the church. "Be ready to tell the organist," he whispered
to a boy who stood near.</p>

<p>The waiting procession fell into partial disarray as
every one craned his or her neck to see the bridegroom
step from the carriage which now halted at the steps. All,
nearly all, could see through the open doors as the driver
dismounted and opened the door.</p>

<p>A shiver of disappointment passed over the wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
party. An old, bent man issued from the carriage, leaning
heavily on a cane and hobbled up the steps.</p>

<p>"This is stranger than Ivan's delay!" exclaimed Harmon
in a whisper to his Russian colleague; "I don't believe
old Dexter ever went to a wedding before unless it
was his own, and I never knew he was married."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked the Russian.</p>

<p>"Old Dexter is all I can say. He's a kind of miser and
money-lender combined, I think. I don't believe he's any
friend of Ivan's."</p>

<p>"No. He's bowing to Mr. Pembroke."</p>

<p>Very ceremoniously but with a halting movement, the
old man had taken off his hat to Mr. Pembroke and passed
on into the church. Mr. Pembroke had bowed stiffly in
return and then bent over his niece to speak to her.</p>

<p>Clara was by this time plainly disturbed. It was a
quarter past the hour, and the congregation itself was
getting nervous. A few persons came out into the vestibule
to learn what caused the delay. The organist's flitting
harmonies became monotonous, intolerable, and the
rector within the chancel was not so impatient as alarmed.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the organist stopped altogether.
The rector joined the wedding party in the vestibule.
Clara had been taken to a room in the vestry by her
guardian.</p>

<p>"If he should come now," said Mr. Pembroke, gravely,
"I don't believe we could go on. The strain has been too
great for Clara."</p>

<p>Dr. Merrill spoke to her as only a clergyman can speak
to a parishioner, and minutes dragged along.</p>

<p>At last when an hour had passed, and there was yet no
word from Ivan, the rector dismissed the congregation,
and the members of the wedding party went homeward,
wondering and sorrowful.</p>

<p class="center">AN EXPLANATION SUGGESTED.</p>


<p>"Wait for me a moment, Paul," said Ralph Harmon as
the people began to pour out of the church.</p>

<p>He went to the room in the vestry where Clara Hilman
sat pale and tearless. With her were Mr. Pembroke, his
daughter Louise, and two or three other young ladies who
were intimate friends of the unfortunate bride. Ralph did
not approach the group, but paused at the door and looked
significantly at Miss Pembroke. She went to him at once,
and, unseen by the others, he took both her hands in his
and said:</p>

<p>"I am going to Strobel's room and shall take Palovna
with me. If I find any trace or news, as I undoubtedly
shall, I will go directly to your house and report. You
may tell Miss Hilman so if you think it will relieve her."</p>

<p>"Clara, dear!" exclaimed Miss Pembroke, impulsively,
"Ralph is going to find Ivan, and will come back as
quickly as he can to tell you."</p>

<p>For several minutes the bride had been sitting as if petrified,
making no answer to the well-meant questions of
her friends, unconscious apparently of their tearful sympathy,
but at this announcement her eyes were lit by just
a gleam of gratitude and she tried to speak to Ralph. Her
lips quivered with unformed words, and she turned appealingly
to her uncle.</p>

<p>"Come," she faltered, "let us go home."</p>

<p>Ralph bowed and returned immediately to the vestibule,
where Paul Palovna waited for him. Both were accosted
by many of the outgoing audience, but they shook
their heads and hurried down the steps and up the street
to the nearest line of cars. They said little to each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
on the way to Ashburton Place, for they were oppressed
with forebodings, and the consciousness that they had
nothing upon which to base speculation.</p>

<p>Once Ralph exclaimed desperately, "What can have
happened!" and Paul answered, "He must have fallen
violently ill." Both hoped that this might be the case,
and neither believed it. Mrs. White knew them both, for
they were frequent callers upon her lodger, and her surprise,
therefore, passed all bounds when she met them
at the door and heard them ask as with one voice, "Where
is Strobel?"</p>

<p>"Where?" she repeated, "where should he be? Haven't
you seen him?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Ralph, "he did not come to the church,
and the rector dismissed the congregation."</p>

<p>Mrs. White threw up her hands and sank into a chair.
"Why&mdash;why&mdash;" she stammered, "he left here all dressed
and gay as could be."</p>

<p>"Did he seem quite well?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>The good lady remembered her surprise and disappointment
at finding Ivan's eggs unbroken, his breakfast almost
untasted and she told the young men about it.</p>

<p>"That signifies nothing," said Paul; "I don't wonder
he didn't care to eat. Did he appear to be troubled about
anything?"</p>

<p>"Not when he went away," answered Mrs. White; "I
thought he seemed put out when the strange gentleman
called."</p>

<p>"There we have it!" exclaimed Paul, eagerly. "Who
was the caller and what was his business, if you happen
to know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know either. I never saw the gentleman before.
He was here only a few minutes. He sent up his
card, and though I looked at the name, I couldn't remember
it, for it had a strange look, something like yours."</p>

<p>"May we go to his room? The card may still be there."</p>

<p>"I don't think it is," said Mrs. White, rising to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the young men who were already half way up the stairs;
"I don't remember seeing it when I cleaned up."</p>

<p>When Ralph and Paul had vainly examined the catch-alls,
the vases, and every probable place into which a visitor's
card might have been tucked, the Russian asked
what had been done with the contents of the waste
basket.</p>

<p>"My daughter Lizzie helped me," replied Mrs. White,
"and took the waste papers downstairs. I'll ask her to
find them and look for the card."</p>

<p>She left the room, and while she was gone the young
men moved about nervously, repeatedly asking who the
caller could have been, what possible connection his call
could have had with Ivan's failure to appear at his wedding,
and all manner of questions, vain and irritating, that
arise when men are confronted by an emergency that
teems with mystery. Mrs. White reported that her
daughter had gone out and that the waste paper from
Mr. Strobel's room had been burned.</p>

<p>"Lizzie may have seen that card," she said, "and I'll
ask her when she comes in. I can't think where she can
have gone."</p>

<p>"Was she here when the stranger called?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and until after Mr. Strobel started away. I
didn't know that she had left the house, and I can't imagine
what she went out for. Perhaps she'll be back soon."</p>

<p>"Do you know where Strobel hired his carriage?"
inquired Paul.</p>

<p>"No, I don't. Lizzie might, for I remember he said
something to her about it the day before. I wonder
where she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He probably ordered his carriage from Clark &amp;
Brown," said Ralph to Paul. He had no intention of ignoring
Mrs. White's motherly anxiety about her daughter,
but he saw no reason for attaching significance to her
absence, and his mind was burdened with a growing conviction
that something serious had happened to his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose we make some inquiries," responded Paul.
"If you will go to Clark &amp; Brown's office, I will take a
run around all the hotel cab-stands in the vicinity. He
might have left his order at the Tremont House or in Bosworth
Street, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm agreed," said Ralph. "We must get hold of the
man who drove him. One of us is likely to succeed. Suppose,
as Strobel may after all turn up at any minute, we
meet here as soon as we can. I'll take in the Revere
House as well as Clark &amp; Brown's."</p>

<p>"I wish you would meet here, gentlemen," interposed
Mrs. White; "Lizzie may be back then."</p>

<p>"I hope she will be, Mrs. White," said Ralph. "She
may be able to tell us something about Strobel. It seems
strange that he hasn't sent some word."</p>

<p>"I begin to fear that we shall find him at a hospital,
badly injured," remarked Paul.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not!" exclaimed Mrs. White. "I declare!
it makes me feel dreadfully about Lizzie."</p>

<p>The young men departed at once upon their errands. It
was Paul Palovna who came upon a clew. He found
where Ivan had engaged his carriage, and he went to the
livery stable, which was in the South End, to find what
had become of the driver and his passenger. He arrived
there just after the driver had come in with his damaged
carriage.</p>

<p>"I started in with the gentleman," said the driver,
"but I broke down at the corner of Tremont and Park
Streets and he went along with somebody else."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never saw the cabman before."</p>

<p>"Whose rig was it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that, either. I never saw the horse before,
and the carriage was like hundreds of others that
you might see in Boston any day."</p>

<p>Paul tried to think what ought to be done next.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Strobel have a second accident?" asked one of
the stable proprietors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear so," replied Paul; "we haven't seen him, and as
he was going to his own wedding, his failure to turn up is
rather alarming."</p>

<p>"Going to be married, was he?" the stableman spoke
thoughtfully. "Then I guess you'll find that he has been
made the victim of a practical joke. I suppose he had
plenty of friends who were aware of his intentions?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, but I cannot imagine," said Paul with some
indignation, "that any of them would have carried a joke
to the extent of keeping him away from his wedding."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," admitted the stableman, "but it looks
as if some one had deliberately tried to delay him. Don't
you know how the accident happened to our carriage?"</p>

<p>"No. What was the matter?"</p>

<p>"Somebody had loosened the nut of the forward right
wheel so that it was bound to come off before they had
gone very far. The breakdown was no accident."</p>

<p>"You are sure of this, I suppose," exclaimed Paul; "but
when could it have been done?"</p>

<p>"When Mike was waiting in front of the door to Mr.
Strobel's place. You'd better tell this gentleman what
you told me, Mike."</p>

<p>"I waited there a good half hour before Mr. Strobel came
out," replied the driver. "And while I was there a fellow
crossed the street and spoke to me. He stood in the street
kind o' leaning on the wheel. 'Go'n' to take Mr. Strobel
to his wedding?' says he. 'I'm go'n' to take a gent of that
name,' says I 'but I don't know nothing 'bout his wedding.'
'That's what 'tis,' says he, 'and a very fine man he
is, and a fine day it is for the ceremony; and that's a fine
horse you have,' and all that kind of palaver, till I
thought he'd talk me blind. After a while he said good-morning,
and went on, bad luck to him."</p>

<p>Paul looked at the stableman in surprise. "Could the
nut have been removed then without the driver knowing
it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it wasn't necessarily removed. It may have
been started. You get up on the seat and sit back indifferently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
as a driver would be likely to sit. Just try it. I
want you to be satisfied."</p>

<p>Paul climbed to the driver's seat on the coupé, and the
stableman leaned over the wheel.</p>

<p>"You see," said the latter, "unless you bent over and
looked down sharply you wouldn't make out what I was
up to, and not having any reason to suspect a trick, you'd
likely sit still; more likely than not, if you was an ordinary
driver, you'd look the other way most of the time;
and&mdash;but I don't need to talk any longer for here is the
nut!" and he held up a small wrench in which was the
nut of the wheel by which he was standing.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Paul, smiling, in spite of his
anxiety, at the dexterous way in which the stableman had
proved that the trick might have been done. "What sort
of man was this, Mike, who talked to you?"</p>

<p>"I dunno, sir. Medium sized, young, I should say."</p>

<p>"Would you know him again?"</p>

<p>"I would that!"</p>

<p>"By the way, did you see anybody call at the house
while you were waiting?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a gentleman went in. I heard him ask for Mr.
Strobel, and he came out again inside of five minutes."</p>

<p>"What was he like and where did he go?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you what he was like. I paid no attention
to him. He went away toward Somerset Street. The
fellow at the wheel was talking to me as he went along."</p>

<p>This was all the information of value that Paul could
obtain, although he asked many more questions. He
found Ralph waiting for him in Ivan's room, and Mrs.
White was there, overcome with anxiety on account of the
continued absence of her daughter.</p>

<p>"I think," said Ralph when he had heard his friend's report,
"that we'd better speak of this at police headquarters."</p>

<p>"Are you going to say anything about Lizzie?" asked
Mrs. White.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not, unless you wish it. She will doubtless
come in before evening."</p>

<p>"I don't know," murmured the landlady, despairingly;
"she didn't say a word about going out, and I'm dreadfully
afraid! I can't find her little traveling bag&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly as Paul wheeled about and
glanced at her with a startled glance. There was a moment
of silence, and then the Russian said quietly: "I
will come back early in the evening, Mrs. White, and if
your daughter has not appeared, I'll help you to make inquiries.
We must look after Strobel now."</p>

<p>The young men reported the circumstances at police
headquarters and then went to Roxbury. It was five
o'clock when they arrived at Mr. Pembroke's house, and
they cherished a hope that some word from Ivan, if not
Ivan himself, would be found there. They were disappointed.
Louise Pembroke told them that nothing had occurred
except that Clara had succumbed to the shock and
strain, and was under the care of a physician.</p>

<p>"About an hour ago she broke down and cried," said
Louise, "and the physician said it was the best thing that
could have happened to her. He would have been afraid
to have Ivan return before that. Now she is not in any
immediate danger."</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell her what we have done?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll do so now."</p>

<p>Louise found her cousin calm and hopeful.</p>

<p>"Ralph has come back," said Clara. "I heard the bell,
and knew it must be he. Well?"</p>

<p>"Ralph says, dear," replied Louise, "that Ivan started
for the church in a carriage, and that there was a breakdown
on the way that appears to have been caused by a
trick. He then took another carriage, and after that they
do not know what became of him."</p>

<p>"Lou," said the sufferer, "I suppose people would expect
that I should feel humiliation most of all, but I don't,
and if I did I should no longer feel it now that I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Ivan started for the church. Don't you see? He meant to
come, of course! Something dreadful has happened to
him&mdash;" Her eyes filled with tears, and she paused a
moment before continuing: "There must be more details,
of course, but I am not well enough yet to hear them.
Ask Ralph and Paul to come to-morrow morning, will you,
please? I must talk with them."</p>

<p>"I will," replied Louise; "Ivan may come before that."</p>

<p>Ralph went to his home immediately after leaving Mr.
Pembroke's, but Paul, who had no other home than a
furnished room in a lodging house, returned according
to his promise to see Mrs. White. He felt that there
might be a chance that the daughter, Lizzie, could throw
some light on Ivan's movements, but he had no doubt
whatever that she herself had returned. He reached the
house just as a postman was leaving it. Mrs. White stood
in the hall, the door remaining open, nervously opening
a letter. When she had read it she screamed, and would
have fallen to the floor had not Paul sprung forward to
catch her. She recovered in a moment sufficiently to sob:</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you've come. Lizzie has gone! Read what
she says."</p>

<p>Paul took the letter which she tremblingly handed him
and read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>: I am going away and shall not come back for a
long time. Do not be anxious, and do not try to find me. You are
not to blame for anything, and I cannot now tell you why I go.
Some time I may do so, and I may write to you. I don't know yet.
Do not think unkindly of me. You will know some time that it is
best. I love you and&mdash;&mdash;"</p></blockquote>

<p>Two words here had been laboriously scratched out.
Then came the signature, "Lizzie." Paul made out the
erased words to be "I love."</p>

<p>In spite of himself a dreadful fear came over him, a
fear of something more painful for all of Ivan's friends
to bear than an accident, no matter how serious.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="center">AN IMPERFECT VISION.</p>


<p>Ivan Strobel had been a lodger in Mrs. White's house
for more than two years. During the greater part of that
period he had been the only lodger, and from the beginning
his relations with his landlady had been more as if
he were a friend of the family than merely a tenant. His
evenings were not infrequently spent in Mrs. White's sitting-room,
where his strongly domestic nature found some
comfort in reading aloud to the old lady and her daughter,
or in playing cards, or in telling them stories of European
life. Sometimes his friends would call, and find him there
instead of in his own room, and more than once he had
been the target for good-humored chaffing relative to his
supposed fondness for the landlady's daughter.</p>

<p>On such occasions Strobel laughed lightly, as if it were
out of the question that anybody should seriously harbor
a supposition that he was in love with Lizzie. That was in
the comparatively early days of his residence there; and
one afternoon, about a year before his eventful wedding
morning, Ralph Harmon and Paul Palovna called together
and found him in his own quarters, serving Russian tea to
Mrs. White and her daughter. He was evidently delighted
to see his friends, and he promptly set glasses of the fragrant,
hot beverage before them. Mrs. White was enthusiastic
in her praise of the tea, as well she might be, for
Russians are past-masters in the art of tea-brewing, and
Ivan was one of the most skillful; and she slyly intimated
that the woman who would have the first place in his
future household would do well to place him in charge of
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Ivan smiled and blushed as if pleased at the allusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and while his friends commended the idea with noisy
laughter, Miss Lizzie sat silent, sipping her tea with downcast
eyes. Shortly afterward the ladies withdrew, and
Palovna immediately began to tease Strobel about Lizzie.</p>

<p>"On my word, Ivan," he cried, "you begin very badly.
If you show her what a fine hand you have for kitchen-work,
you'll never have any time to yourself after you're
married. It's a fine thing to serve tea to your friends
when you're a bachelor, but fancy a man setting the kettle
to boil for his wife! Great Scott! what a picture!"</p>

<p>Both visitors laughed heartily, but Strobel, with a grave
smile, held up one hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"I don't mind your raillery in the least," he said, "but
it does injustice to the young lady who is the innocent
subject of it rather than myself. I'm glad you came in as
you did, for I have something to tell you, and, in fact, it
was to tell Mrs. White and Lizzie the same thing that I invited
them to take tea with me. I am engaged to Miss
Hilman."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad to hear it, and I congratulate you,"
exclaimed Ralph, jumping up and grasping Ivan by the
hand.</p>

<p>"And I, too," said Paul, not less sincerely; "pardon my
joking. I hadn't suspected that the wind blew from that
direction. When is it to be?"</p>

<p>Then Strobel told them about his plans, and from that
day until this minute, when Paul stood by the weeping
landlady, with her daughter's incoherent letter in his
hand, he had never associated Ivan and Lizzie in any
other way than as ordinary friends. When, earlier in the
afternoon, Mrs. White had said something that seemed to
suggest the possibility that they had gone away together,
Paul's indignation had been aroused, and it was with an
effort that he had mastered his tongue, which fairly
burned to deny such an outrageous assumption. He had
dismissed the thought later, with the conviction that
Mrs. White could not have realized the true significance
of her words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, utterly at a loss to account for his friends' absence,
he was compelled to face any suggestion that arose
and make the best of it.</p>

<p>"There is at least some comfort in this, Mrs. White," he
said, unsteadily; "you know that your daughter is alive,
and she says she may write to you. She would not have
written this had she meant to hide herself completely
from you."</p>

<p>The mother's anguish was not to be tempered with this
argument. The poignant fact remained that her daughter
had gone away, deserted her home, and neglected deliberately
to take her mother into her confidence.</p>

<p>"How could she?" moaned Mrs. White; "why, oh, why
has she done this?"</p>

<p>Paul had hard questions to ask, hard for him as well as
for her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. White," he said, "you have shown me Lizzie's
letter; will you let me help you if I can?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" she answered eagerly, raising her tearful
eyes. The very proffer of sympathy and assistance helped
to restore her to some degree of composure, and she
opened the door to the sitting-room. "I forgot where we
were," she said apologetically; "please come in and sit
down."</p>

<p>Paul complied, and, still with the letter in his hand, began:
"I shall have to ask questions that would be impertinent
if you had not said that I might try to help you.
Do you&mdash;was Lizzie engaged?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" replied Mrs. White, with a little gasp; "what
made you think so?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, and what I really tried to ask was
whether she were in love with anybody?"</p>

<p>Mrs. White looked doubtfully at him. Her eyes were
dry now, and she toyed nervously with her apron.</p>

<p>"My daughter didn't tell me she was going away," she
answered slowly after a minute; "if she wouldn't tell me
that, how should you expect that she would speak to me
of her love&mdash;if she did love anybody?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul was somewhat nettled at this apparent effort to
juggle with his question. The situation seemed to him too
serious to admit of anything but the most complete frankness.</p>

<p>"I don't ask how you know, or why you don't, Mrs.
White," he said as gently as he could; "I simply asked for
a statement of fact."</p>

<p>The landlady looked down at the floor, evidently trying
to frame an answer. Paul would have dropped the matter
right there, disgusted at her reticence if not her indirection,
had he not been determined to learn everything possible
that might throw light upon the fate of his friends.
So he began on another tack.</p>

<p>"Weren't you invited to Strobel's wedding, Mrs.
White?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied promptly, not suspecting the ultimate
aim of the question; "both of us received invitations."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go?"</p>

<p>"Lizzie didn't want to go. She said weddings always
made her feel solemn, and I didn't want to go without
her."</p>

<p>"Wasn't there a deeper reason, Mrs. White, for your
daughter's reluctance to go to Ivan Strobel's wedding?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, Mr. Palovna," said the
landlady, glancing at him and averting her eyes.</p>

<p>Paul wanted to tell her that she was trying to dodge
him, but he controlled himself and said:</p>

<p>"I mean that in my opinion your daughter was hopelessly
in love with Ivan."</p>

<p>This statement did not provoke the storm that Paul had
expected. Mrs. White's reserve had prepared him for an
outburst of denials, indignant tears and the like, but the
old lady sat very still, her hands clasped upon her lap,
and after a little silence she spoke dreamily:</p>

<p>"Lizzie never told me, but I guessed as much long ago,
poor, dear girl!"</p>

<p>Paul's heart sank as he felt his fears growing to conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
that the flight of Lizzie White was closely connected
with the disappearance of Ivan Strobel. He was not disloyal
to his friend even in his thoughts; he kept insisting
to himself that Ivan was not the man to play all his friends
double, but even as he rebelled against this possible explanation
of the matter, reason interposed its stern voice
to say that if, after all, Strobel had discovered that he
loved Lizzie and not Clara, this was the probable course
he would take to avoid facing the comments and criticisms
of his friends; and although he repelled the explanation
with all his will, he nevertheless felt a dreadful sense of
doubt.</p>

<p>"Mrs. White," he said gravely, "have you any reason
to think that Strobel and your daughter went away together?"</p>

<p>The landlady started as if she had been shot.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" she cried; "how could you think such
a thing? Why should you insult my poor child&mdash;&mdash;" and
she broke down and sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>Palovna was miserable. He saw that he had utterly
misinterpreted Mrs. White's reluctance in answering
his questions; that, far from suspecting that Lizzie's departure
might be an elopement with Ivan, she had instinctively
tried to guard her daughter's secret.</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly sorry that I have hurt you," said Paul,
contritely, "I don't think, cannot think that they have
gone together; but, you see, I am in such a maze of
anxiety about Strobel, everything is so strange and uncertain,
that I&mdash;I hardly knew what I said."</p>

<p>He paused, and Mrs. White, still sobbing, uttered some
words of which the only one he understood was "cruel,"
and he promptly accepted it as applied to himself.</p>

<p>"I can only repeat that I am sorry," he said. "Here is
your letter. I fear I can be of no help to you unless you
want me to take some message for you."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you cannot do anything now&mdash;I know you didn't
mean it. Please come again to-morrow&mdash;when I can think&mdash;please,
Mr. Palovna."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>So Paul left the house, wondering whether Mrs. White
felt any unhappier than himself.</p>

<p>He turned into Pemberton Square, and went as far as
the door to police headquarters, halted abruptly and
turned away. He could not be the one to fasten a suspicion
of such a character upon his missing friend. If it
were true that he had eloped, that ugly fact would be established
soon enough without his giving any hints to the
police detectives who were assigned to hunt for Ivan.</p>

<p>The doctor had ordered Clara Hilman to bed, and under
the first prostration of the blow she had willingly obeyed;
but as evening came on and her mind cleared, she felt
stronger, and at supper time she arose and dressed. She
did not go down to the dining-room, and Louise brought
delicacies to her chamber. She wished that Ralph and
Paul would return, for she felt that she could talk with
them now, and she longed intensely for any word, however
insignificant, concerning her lover's movements.
Louise sat with her, making well-intended efforts to distract
her attention from the subject that was so terribly
engrossing, and offering the comfort of hopeful assurances
when it was evident that Clara could think of
nothing else.</p>

<p>The fact was that Louise disturbed Clara. Her thoughts
were fixed in their own channel, and so obstinately clung
there that it grew wearisome to attend to the interruptions
that Louise was constantly making. So Clara said at
last:</p>

<p>"I think, dear, if you will forgive me, I would like to
be alone a little while. I will call if I want anything."</p>

<p>"To be sure, Clara," responded Louise, rising at once
and putting her arms affectionately around her cousin; "I
will go to my own room, and will come the minute you
need me. Shall I get you anything to read?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot do anything but think, and I must think.
Don't be alarmed. I am not going to let myself become
ill."</p>

<p>There was a faint, sweet smile upon her sad lips as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
spoke, and, left to herself, she sat leaning slightly forward,
her chin upon one hand, the other clinched upon
her lap, gazing intently at the wall which she saw not. In
its place was the carriage in front of Mrs. White's house,
and as she watched it she saw the house door open and
Ivan, her Ivan, come forth. She saw him turn to say
good-by to the kind-hearted landlady, saw the happy
smile upon his face, saw him enter the carriage, saw it
start slowly away.</p>

<p>This much of her lover's wedding journey was as clearly
before her as if it were now occurring, and she were at a
window in the house across the way from Mrs. White's in
Ashburton Place. Her nerves strained to their utmost
tension, she tried to follow the carriage. She could see
that it turned into Somerset Street, but when it seemed
to be at Beacon she could not tell which way it went.
That it was still moving was apparent, but there was a
confusion of vehicles and persons, streets and buildings,
there was a pause&mdash;somewhere&mdash;was Ivan getting out?
Was that he taking another carriage? Oh! why was not
Paul here to tell her just what happened at this point,
wherever it was? Why had she not heard his report when
he was there to make it?</p>

<p>Suddenly the confusion gave way, and the familiar wall
was before her, but still she saw it not. Now she was listening.
Did she hear her lover's name? Was it spoken in
anger? It must be! it must be! They were speaking of
him; who were they? In this house? where else if she
heard it? Could it be that she had heard nothing? To her
ear there was no tangible sound save the ticking of the
clock on the mantel. Clara arose and crossed the room,
staggering with weakness, and placed her hand upon the
door. One instant she waited as if in doubt, and then she
opened it very softly. Yes! there were voices below; they
were in the library; that was her uncle speaking. Had
she a right to listen? She stole to the head of the stairs
and looked down. The library door was closed. The voice
was an unintelligible murmur, nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Down the stairs she crept and came to the library door.</p>

<p>"Are you money-mad?" It was her uncle who spoke.
"Don't you know that it hasn't come, that such a thing
can't be effected in a moment?"</p>

<p>"And I tell you, Mat Pembroke," said a harsh voice,
"that you've got&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voice suddenly stopped, and the speaker, the infirm
old man who had arrived late at the church while the
wedding party was waiting in the vestibule, half rose
from his big chair and pointed with a bony, trembling
hand over Mr. Pembroke's shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke turned about and saw Clara Hilman with
wide-open eyes and pale face standing just within the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, uncle," she said in a voice scarce above a
whisper; "I thought you were speaking of Ivan, and I&mdash;I
came down to say that I am going to find him."</p>

<p>She swayed slightly as she finished, and Mr. Pembroke
ran forward and took her in his arms.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">CLARA'S SEARCH BEGINS.</p>


<p>Clara had not fainted in her uncle's arms, but she
nestled against him quivering and sobbing; and again it
was fortunate for her that the excited, pent-up forces of
her brain had broken through in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"You see, Dexter!" cried Mr. Pembroke in broken accents,
"how my poor girl suffers. There, there, Clara,
better get back to your bed and try to sleep. I thought
Louise was looking after you."</p>

<p>"She has been with me," replied Clara, "but I sent her
away. I wanted to think. Has nothing been heard from
Ivan?"</p>

<p>"Nothing yet, my dear. You shall know it as soon as
we do even if it comes at three in the morning."</p>

<p>Attracted by her cousin's voice, Louise appeared at this
moment and led Clara upstairs, scolding her gently for
having left her room. Clara was greatly subdued, and
urged no longer to be left alone. Through the rest of the
evening she sat quietly listening to Louise, and feeling
no return of that tensity of the nerves that had preceded
and accompanied her waking dream.</p>

<p>In the morning she was better, stronger in every way.
She met her uncle and cousin at breakfast, and although
she was very quiet she seemed more like her natural self
than they had expected. Every newspaper had something
to say about the disappearance of Ivan Strobel, and the reporters,
apparently, had interviewed everybody directly interested
in him except the unhappy bride herself. The
newspapers were in a pile by her uncle's plate when she
surprised him by entering the room and taking her place
at the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to see the papers, uncle," she said after responding
to his greetings.</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke glanced nervously at his daughter, and
laid his hand irresolutely on the pile.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you won't find anything of comfort in
them, my dear," he said.</p>

<p>"No matter," she replied, "I don't expect to. Don't try
to keep them from me. I shall get them later if I do not
read them now."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke passed them all to her except one which
he opened and pretended to read himself. He had already
been through it, and he did not intend, if he could help it,
that she should see it.</p>

<p>Clara intently read the account of the interrupted wedding
in the first paper she took up, pausing only once to
exclaim, "Then the reporters were here last evening!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Pembroke, "they were coming and going
until long after midnight."</p>

<p>"I almost wish I could have seen some of them," murmured
Clara as she continued to read. The report told with
fair accuracy about the break-down at Park and Tremont
Streets and the explanation of it given by the stableman.
Mrs. White was quoted, and as much as the reporter
could imagine was made of the visit to Strobel by the
mysterious stranger. Then there were interviews with the
missing man's employers, State Street bankers, and the
highly gratifying intelligence was set forth that there was
no reason to suppose that Strobel had tampered with the
funds or in any way betrayed his trust. Clara blushed
with indignation as she read that the books would be examined
in the morning, with a view to discovering whether
Strobel had been guilty of any irregularities.</p>

<p>"The idea that Ivan should be suspected of dishonesty!"
exclaimed Clara, laying the paper down and taking up
another.</p>

<p>"People will think anything and everything," said her
uncle, "and you must be prepared for the worst insinuations
and speculations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Clara read the next account in silence. It was much
longer than the first, and a great deal of attention and imagination
had been devoted to the romantic aspect of the
situation. Clara was described as utterly prostrated by the
blow, dangerously ill, refusing to see her most intimate
friends; and the intended union of the beautiful orphan
with the Russian exile was dwelt upon with appropriate
grace and picturesqueness. She blushed for herself this
time and laid the paper down impatiently.</p>

<p>"I shall show them," she said, "if they pay any further
attention to the affair, that I am not prostrated by the
blow, hard as it is."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Clara?" asked Mr. Pembroke and
Louise together.</p>

<p>"Just what I said last evening, uncle. I am going to
find Ivan."</p>

<p>"Why! dear, what can you do?" cried Louise, pityingly.</p>

<p>"Do? I don't know yet what the details will be, but I
can search for him. What better, what else could I do? If
we had been married, and Ivan had disappeared, would it
not be my duty as well as my inclination to turn the
world upside down to find him? Should it make any difference
just because the formal word had not been spoken
that was to make us husband and wife?"</p>

<p>Her voice trembled a little at the end of this brief
speech, and her eyes were moist, but she took up a third
paper resolutely and began to read. She had debated her
situation thoroughly in the long hours of the previous
day and evening, and her determination to devote herself
to the search for her lover was not the effect of a temporary
hallucination. Her uncle and cousin said nothing for
the present either to dissuade or encourage her, Louise, at
least, feeling that in due time Clara would see the futility
of attempting anything on her own account as long as experienced
detectives were in the field. Mr. Pembroke left
the room for a moment, and when he returned the paper
he had been reading was folded and hidden in his pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
There was still another before Clara, and when she had
read it she pushed them all away, saying:</p>

<p>"They're as much alike as if the same man had written
them all."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke was relieved that she did not notice that
one of the morning papers was not included in the lot she
had read.</p>

<p>Hardly had they finished breakfast when the bell rang,
and a reporter for an evening paper inquired for news of
Mr. Strobel and Miss Hilman's health. Mr. Pembroke
frowned with annoyance, but Clara was for seeing the
young man.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be pictured as a useless, waiting, tear-drenched
weakling!" she cried when uncle and cousin
remonstrated. "Publicity? notoriety? what could be
worse than the notoriety I have already acquired? Let me
see him, please, so that he may have no excuse for describing
me as a broken-down, useless incumbrance."</p>

<p>"I will speak to him first," said Mr. Pembroke, hastily.
"Wait here a minute. I'll send for you when I have heard
what it is he wants."</p>

<p>So Clara and Louise remained at the breakfast table,
and a few minutes later Mr. Pembroke opened the door and
said with an assumption of cheerfulness:</p>

<p>"There! you see, sir, the young lady is bearing her
trouble more bravely than the morning papers announced.
This is Miss Hilman, Mr. Shaughnessy, and my daughter,
Louise."</p>

<p>Mr. Shaughnessy, thus introduced, entered the room
bowing with old-fashioned extravagance. His head was
bald as an egg, and his face was three-fourths concealed
by a grizzly beard. The "young man" could no longer
look forward to his sixtieth birthday. He wore gold-bowed
eyeglasses, and in one hand he held hat and note-book
and in the other a stub of a pencil.</p>

<p>"Char-r-med, ladies," he said, "to see you looking so
fine upon this gr-rievous occasion. May I ask, Miss Hilman,
how you passed the night?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>What with surprise at her uncle's maneuver in bringing
the reporter to the breakfast room, and amusement at
the courtly yet business-like manners of the "young
man," Clara could not have repressed a smile if she had
tried; and before she could reply, Mr. Shaughnessy had
whipped his note-book to the top of his hat and written
the significant mnemonic, "smile."</p>

<p>"I slept quite as usual, thank you," replied Clara.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it," said Shaughnessy;
"health, Miss Hilman, is the greatest pr-rop in time of
trouble. Have you any obser-rvation to make upon Mr.
Strobel's absence? Any theor-ry to account for it?"</p>

<p>"No theory, Mr. Shaughnessy, though I hope to have
one some time later in the day. I should like to have you
tell your readers that I have absolute faith in Mr. Strobel,
and that I expect any theory as to his disappearance to
accord with honorable conduct on his part."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the reporter, scribbling away for dear
life, that he might not lose a word of this important utterance.
"Do I understand you to say that you expect to
have news of your&mdash;Mr. Strobel before the day is over?"</p>

<p>"I shall devote all my time to searching for him."</p>

<p>"Clara!" exclaimed Louise, while Mr. Pembroke turned
away with a despairing shrug.</p>

<p>Shaughnessy looked doubtingly at Mr. Pembroke, and
then said:</p>

<p>"May I have the honor of calling on you later, then?"</p>

<p>"I shall be glad at any time," replied Clara, "to give
you any information in my power."</p>

<p>Shaughnessy made a note.</p>

<p>"I hope you will pardon me seeming imper-rtinence,
Miss Hilman," he continued, "but me city editor commanded
me to obtain photographs of yourself and Mr.
Strobel."</p>

<p>Louise sighed and looked genuinely alarmed; but Clara
thought a moment, and answered that she would loan the
reporter pictures if he would be sure to return them uninjured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be sure to do so," he answered, "and I commend
your decision. It saves me a lot of trouble, for, of course,
I must obey me city editor; he's a tyrant, Miss Hilman,
and if you did not give me the pictures, I should have to
get them elsewhere."</p>

<p>Clara smiled as she left the room to get the photographs,
and when she had given them to Shaughnessy he took his
departure, promising to call again.</p>

<p>"How could you give him the pictures, Clara?" asked
Louise reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Mine will do no harm," answered Clara, quietly;
"didn't you hear him say he was bound to get it anyway?
Moreover, it may help in discovering Ivan, if only they
will print a good likeness of him."</p>

<p>Clara was right in one respect at least. Nearly every
evening paper published pictures of herself and Ivan, and
nobody at the Pembroke house could have told where the
originals were obtained.</p>

<p>"Now I must keep my word and begin the search," said
Clara after the reporter had gone.</p>

<p>"You're not going to leave the house, I hope?" exclaimed
her uncle.</p>

<p>"Certainly, uncle," she replied; "I feel quite well, and I
will not overtax myself. I can stand anything better than
staying idle here."</p>

<p>"I am strongly disposed to forbid you," said Mr. Pembroke,
anxiously; "you are sure to have a most disagreeable
and painful experience."</p>

<p>"Please don't go!" cried Louise, who had read the paper
that Mr. Pembroke had concealed.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to displease you both," returned Clara, "but
if I am forbidden to go I shall have to disobey."</p>

<p>"Then Louise must go with you," said her uncle.</p>

<p>"I should like to have her. Will you, Lou, dear?"</p>

<p>Louise was only too anxious to accompany her cousin,
and accordingly they left the house together just in time
to escape a squad of reporters representing the other evening
papers. Clara had arranged her programme the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
before, and left word at the house for Ralph and Paul,
should they come in her absence, to go to Ivan's room.
Mrs. White had seen Clara on the few occasions when Mr.
Strobel had served afternoon tea to his intended and other
friends, and she fell into a great flurry of agitation when
she recognized her at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," she stammered as she led the way; "of
course I am glad to see you, for I am certain you cannot
believe it."</p>

<p>Louise tried to check the landlady from making the inevitable
revelation, but Clara laid one hand on her cousin's
arm and asked:</p>

<p>"Believe what, Mrs. White?"'</p>

<p>"Why, what's in the paper," replied the landlady;
"you've read the papers, I suppose? I presumed that was
why you came."</p>

<p>"I read the papers," said Clara, "and I came to inquire
about Ivan. Do you refer to the suggested irregularities
in his accounts? Of course I do not believe anything of
that kind."</p>

<p>"Dear, no! I didn't suppose you did. I meant about my
daughter Lizzie."</p>

<p>"Your daughter!" exclaimed Clara in a low voice,
while Louise hid her face in her hands. "What do you
mean? Let me see the paper."</p>

<p>More agitated than ever, Mrs. White produced a copy of
the paper that Mr. Pembroke had withheld from his
niece.</p>

<p>"I must have overlooked this," said Clara, wonderingly,
as she saw that the account differed in style from those
she had read. The reporter of this paper, sharper than his
rivals, had somehow discovered that Lizzie White had left
her home, and he set forth the circumstances with every
delicate turn that language would allow to suggest a connection
between her flight and Ivan's disappearance.</p>

<p>"It is shrewdly suspected by the friends of Strobel," so
the story ran, "that as the time of his marriage approached,
he found his fancy for Miss White stronger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
his love for Miss Hilman, and that he chose elopement
with the former as less dishonorable than marriage with
the latter."</p>

<p>The writer then proceeded to an elaborate explanation
of how Strobel might himself have arranged the wheel of
his coupé so that it would fall off, and how he might
then, by previous understanding with the second cabman,
who was also conveniently missing, have been driven to
the Park Square railroad station, where he waited for
Miss White. It was entirely possible that they might have
taken the one o'clock train for New York, if not the noon
train.</p>

<p>Clara was very pale when she laid the paper down, but
her faith in Ivan was not so much as touched by doubt.</p>

<p>"It's an outrage," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"I knew you wouldn't believe it!" exclaimed Mrs.
White.</p>

<p>"Believe it! of course it isn't true! It's not possible!"</p>

<p>There was a ring at the door just then, and Mrs. White
excused herself to answer it.</p>

<p>She opened upon Ivan's mysterious visitor, Alexander
Poubalov.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE AGENT OF THE CZAR.</p>


<p>"Good-morning," said Poubalov, gutturally; "this is
Madame White, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the landlady, impressed at once by
the stranger's deferential manner, and believing that
through him the mystery would be cleared away; "won't
you come in?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, yes. I have called to inquire for my friend
Strobel."</p>

<p>"You are not the first, sir," said Mrs. White, opening
the door to the sitting-room. "There are two here now
who will be glad to see you. Miss Hilman, this is the gentleman
who called on Mr. Strobel yesterday morning.
Miss Hilman was to have married him, you know, and
this is Miss Pembroke," and having thus awkwardly initiated
a new scene, Mrs. White took refuge in the nearest
chair.</p>

<p>Poubalov was as near to showing surprise as he ever
permitted himself to come, and Clara, rising impulsively,
went directly to him and said:</p>

<p>"Then you can tell me something about Mr. Strobel,
can you not?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing," he answered gravely; "I
came for information myself."</p>

<p>Clara looked into his eyes searchingly, and went back
to her chair feeling that her greatest hope had been
dashed to the ground.</p>

<p>"I feel the awkwardness of my position, ladies," continued
Poubalov (I make no attempt to suggest his dialect,
which was at times almost unintelligible, as there
was nothing of a humorous or trivial character in his conversation).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
"Every newspaper makes me out as a possible
foe to Mr. Strobel, a mysterious ogre going about seeking
to destroy young men, and perhaps I should not blame
anybody for supposing that I might have been concerned
in preventing Mr. Strobel's marriage, but I assure you
that I was not. I did not know of his intentions until yesterday
morning, when he told me about it himself. I am
as much surprised as anybody to read of his disappearance."</p>

<p>Poubalov paused and with marked deliberation took out
his card case.</p>

<p>"It was but natural," said Clara, tremulously, "that
we should hope that you could throw some light on his
movements, for knowing nothing except that somebody
had called on him unexpectedly, we could not fail to attribute
something significant to the visit."</p>

<p>"Especially," put in Mrs. White, "as the young men
and I hunted the house over for your card and couldn't
find it."</p>

<p>"All very natural," responded Poubalov, imperturbably,
"and it was a circumstance of the utmost triviality
in itself that lent color to my mysterious coming and going.
You remember, Mrs. White, do you not, that you
took my card to Mr. Strobel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and he&mdash;I don't want to give offense&mdash;he
didn't seem particularly pleased to see it."</p>

<p>"So you told the newspaper men. I am not in the least
offended. Here is the card you took to him. I asked Mr.
Strobel where I might call upon him after his wedding
tour, and he wrote that address upon my own card. Of
course I took it away with me." He handed the card to
Clara, adding: "I want you to see that I am concealing
nothing, and if my voluntary return to this house did not
signify anything, your suspicions should certainly be relieved
by seeing that Strobel himself made a semi-appointment
with me at his future home."</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Poubalov," said Clara, with her eyes upon
the card, "that you will forgive us for cherishing any unjust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
suspicions. At the worst, they were vague, and everything
is so confusing."</p>

<p>"I feel that there is nothing to forgive," began Poubalov,
graciously, when Mrs. White interrupted, her mind
naturally intent upon her own trouble:</p>

<p>"And such horrid things as they say, too! You said you
had read the papers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all of them."</p>

<p>"Did you read about my daughter?" and the distressed
mother rose, and, taking the newspaper from Clara's lap,
thrust it into his hands. Without looking at it, Poubalov
answered:</p>

<p>"I read it."</p>

<p>"And what do you think of it?" cried Mrs. White, stemming
a fresh flood of tears.</p>

<p>Poubalov's brows contracted slightly as a sign that he
disapproved forcing this question forward at the time,
and with a grave glance at Clara he replied:</p>

<p>"I do not think. I watch, ask questions, and listen."</p>

<p>Clara hardly knew whether to be encouraged or depressed
by this answer. Unless this man were an intimate
friend of Ivan, it was perhaps not to be expected that he
should see the folly of supposing for an instant that the
missing man had eloped with Lizzie White.</p>

<p>"Mr. Poubalov," she said, "the reports in the newspapers
do not throw the least light on this matter. I have
no criticism to make on their statements of fact, but their
conjectures of every kind are idle. They do not even disturb
me."</p>

<p>Poubalov bowed as if to signify that he heard and understood.</p>

<p>"The cause of his disappearance," she continued after
a moment, "it is yet to be found. The newspapers have
not even hinted at it."</p>

<p>"You have an idea, then," he said, "as to the correct
explanation?"</p>

<p>"No, not one," she answered; "I can only think of
accident; but had there been any accident so serious as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
to render him unconscious and helpless, the police would
have discovered it and reported it by this time, would
they not?"</p>

<p>"They would if your police are nearly as efficient as
those of European cities," said Poubalov, "and I have no
doubt they are so to the extent of such emergencies as
this case presents."</p>

<p>"Then, don't you see, the whole mystery is confined to
two general solutions; either Mr. Strobel was seized by
enemies and carried away; or he had some powerful reason
for absenting himself, and disappeared voluntarily."</p>

<p>The Russian was surprised and deeply impressed by the
young lady's clearness of vision, and Louise, listening
with rapt attention, was simply amazed to hear her
cousin reason so calmly when every word she uttered
must have cost her pain.</p>

<p>"And which of these hypotheses," asked Poubalov,
guardedly, "do you consider the more probable?"</p>

<p>"I have no means of judging between them," replied
Clara, "for I have no fact except the disappearance to
justify either one. It seems as if there must be some other
theory, if I could only think what it is."</p>

<p>"There is no other," said Poubalov, "if you eliminate
accident, as I think you properly do."</p>

<p>"Then I must consider what grounds there might be for
supporting both hypotheses. As I discard as utterly
worthless all the suggestions in the newspapers, I must
suppose that Mr. Strobel had enemies, and that these enemies
were powerful enough either to abduct him in broad
day on a crowded thoroughfare, or cause him such sudden
fear that he felt obliged to go into hiding."</p>

<p>Again was Poubalov surprised, for he could not himself
have reasoned more clearly, or have stated his conclusions
more concisely; but he simply nodded gravely, expressing
neither convictions or emotions. Clara wished that he
would speak. She had expressed her thoughts as they
came to her there in Mrs. White's sitting room. It was
thinking aloud rather than a statement of previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
formed conclusions. Now she saw to just what end her
arguments were bringing her, and she almost shrank
from it. Summoning her utmost resolution she looked
straight at the sombre face of the Russian and added:</p>

<p>"I have no knowledge of Ivan's enemies, Mr. Poubalov;
isn't it possible that you can give some information on
that phase of the case?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," replied Poubalov, without hesitation. Then
he paused a moment before he continued: "Were not the
case so serious and for you so distressing, I should feel
that I must compliment you on your unusual faculty for
analyzing a situation. Far from taking offense at your
continued suspicion of me, I am really pleased."</p>

<p>"I have not said that I suspected you."</p>

<p>"You did not need to, Miss Hilman. Your reason tells
you that Mr. Strobel was happy and confident of the future
until suddenly one Poubalov appears before him like
the ghost of past misfortunes and as a prophet of new
ones."</p>

<p>"I assure you," interrupted Clara again, "that I did not
know that you were not an intimate friend of Mr. Strobel's;
I spoke simply of natural inferences."</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," said the Russian, "you were
helpless in the hands of your own reason."</p>

<p>Clara was silent. She felt instinctively that her analysis
was correct and that she was facing, if not one of Ivan's
enemies, at the least a man who represented all that
might be hostile to him; and when she had endeavored to
withdraw some of the force of her reasoning, he himself
had held her to her conclusions and clinched them.</p>

<p>"It was my intention," continued Poubalov, "to learn
from Mrs. White who you were, that I might solicit the
privilege of calling upon you and laying before you what is
in my knowledge concerning Mr. Strobel, for I fear that
I may&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly and looked from one to another of
the wondering ladies.</p>

<p>"Go on, please," exclaimed Clara, now stirred by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
growing agitation; "if you can give us the faintest light
it would be cruel to withhold it."</p>

<p>"May I hope that no offense will be taken," said Poubalov,
"if I say that I planned to tell these things to you
only? I will be pleased to call at your own convenience."</p>

<p>"No, no!" replied Clara, rising; "I must know now.
Tell me here. Mrs. White, may we step into your dining-room?"</p>

<p>Louise and the landlady had risen at the same moment,
and Mrs. White said:</p>

<p>"If Miss Pembroke doesn't object, she and I will go out.
Only, Mr.&mdash;sir, if you have anything to say about my
daughter, I wish you would let me hear it!"</p>

<p>"It was not my intention to mention her, madame," replied
Poubalov.</p>

<p>Louise went to Clara's side and kissed her.</p>

<p>"You are so brave, dear!" she said.</p>

<p>Clara gave Louise a grateful look as she and Mrs. White
withdrew, and turned expectantly to the Russian.</p>

<p>"Pray sit down, Miss Hilman," he said; "what I have
to say may not be as important and useful to you as you
hope, but I preferred, and with good reason, as I think you
will see, to discuss the matter with you alone. It was on
my tongue to say that I may have been innocently a part
of the cause that sent Mr. Strobel into hiding."</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered Clara, eagerly; "go on!"</p>

<p>"Miss Hilman, I am an agent of the czar."</p>

<p>Poubalov paused as if he expected this announcement to
disturb, or otherwise impress his listener seriously, but
she merely looked straight at him, as she did when he began
to speak.</p>

<p>"Strobel knew me in that capacity," he continued,
"years ago when we were in Russia. Has he ever told you
about his life there?"</p>

<p>"A little," replied Clara, very doubtful how much she
ought to reveal to this man who represented the autocratic,
relentless power that had destroyed the fortune of
the Strobel family and made Ivan himself an exile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"You find it difficult to be frank with me," said Poubalov,
"and I am not surprised, but you must remember that
I am setting the example. It is quite the habit of thoughtless
persons to apply an opprobrious epithet to my occupation
and call me a spy. Well, then, I, Alexander Poubalov,
spy, paid by the government of Russia, tell you who I
am, and tell you that at one time Ivan Strobel had reason
to fear me."</p>

<p>The door bell rang while Poubalov was speaking and
Clara heard Mrs. White pattering through the hall to
answer it.</p>

<p>The man at the door was known to the landlady as
Strobel's tailor, an undersized, forlorn-looking man who
seemed always to be struggling with secret woe. She knew
that Strobel had been kind to him, and helped him in
more ways than mere patronage, and she knew that poor
Litizki was as grateful and loyal as a dog. It was with
sincere welcome, therefore, that she greeted him, and
asked him into the house.</p>

<p>"I only came," said the tailor, "to ask if there is any
news of Mr. Strobel? The newspapers say he has disappeared."</p>

<p>"We know nothing of him here," answered Mrs. White;
"but come in, do! There's no telling who may say the
word that will put us all on the right track. Miss Hilman
is here, the lady he was to marry, you know. She's talking
with a gentleman now in the parlor. I presume she
may like to see you."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can give her any help," said
Litizki, following the landlady into the dining-room, "but
I'll wait a few minutes, for I wanted to know something
that the papers do not make clear."</p>

<p>He came to a sudden halt as he stepped into the dining-room,
where the voices of the persons in the front room
were heard much more distinctly than in the hall.</p>

<p>"Who is that talking?" he exclaimed in an excited
whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a gentleman who called on Mr. Strobel yesterday,"
replied Mrs. White; "I can't think of his name."</p>

<p>"I should know that voice," muttered Litizki as if
speaking to himself.</p>

<p>The rooms were separated by folding doors with glazed
glass panels. On one of the panels there was a tiny spot
where the opaque glaze had been rubbed or knocked off.
Litizki applied his eye to that spot, and shaded the glass
with his hand, straining to get a clear view of the man
whose deep voice came to him like the distant rumble of
an organ.</p>

<p>After a moment he straightened up and turned about,
his sallow, depressed features gleaming with savage
interest.</p>

<p>"I cannot see clearly," he whispered, "but if that is
Alexander Poubalov, then the whole mystery of Strobel's
disappearance is cleared away!"</p>

<p class="center">LITIZKI AT WORK.</p>


<p>"It would have been perfectly natural," continued Poubalov,
"for Strobel to suspect me at first blush of evil
intentions, and I presume he did so; for, without inquiring
what brought me to America and to him, he took
pains to remind me that he was within the jurisdiction
of the United States, and that it was not his purpose to
set foot outside the limits of your country, of which I presume
he is by this time a citizen."</p>

<p>"He has taken out his first papers," replied Clara.</p>

<p>"And, therefore, should have felt himself secure from
one who, supposing he were hostile, yet acted as the official
of a foreign and a friendly government. I give you
credit, Miss Hilman, of drawing a correct conclusion from
that statement of relations."</p>

<p>Poubalov paused, and Clara responded slowly:</p>

<p>"It ought to mean that he had other enemies than you or
those whom you represent."</p>

<p>"Exactly; but why do you hedge&mdash;pardon the term&mdash;why
do you set forth the conclusion with reservation? 'It
ought to mean,' is what you said. Why not say it does
mean?"</p>

<p>"Because I do not know whether you are telling me the
truth."</p>

<p>Poubalov leaned back in his chair, and his dark face was
momentarily illumined by an amused smile.</p>

<p>"May I light a cigarette?" he asked in a tone that
seemed to say how patient he was under this continuance
of suspicion that not even reason could dissipate. It was
as if he had said, "With all your unexpected cleverness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
as a logician, Miss Hilman, you are yet a woman, and you
cling desperately to woman's reasonless intuitions."</p>

<p>"Oh, pardon me if I am cruelly unjust," cried Clara,
as clearly the woman in her quick relenting as she was in
following her intuitions; "have patience with me! You
must know how distressed I am, and how hard it is to
think clearly. Your very admission that you are a paid
spy suggests deceit and trickery&mdash;I suppose I am making
the matter worse."</p>

<p>"By no means, Miss Hilman," replied Poubalov, holding
a cigarette between his fingers; "we shall come to an
understanding presently, I am sure. I never take offense,
not even when my loyalty to the czar is doubted; and
nothing you may say will prevent me from doing what I
can to clear away the mystery surrounding Mr. Strobel."</p>

<p>"Please light your cigarette," said Clara; "if you
wouldn't make me talk, we should get on better."</p>

<p>Poubalov smiled again, and when he had puffed a great
cloud of fragrant smoke from his lips, he resumed:</p>

<p>"I will proceed as if you cherished no doubts as to my
sincerity. It follows, from my analysis, that Mr. Strobel
could have had no fear of harm coming to him from an
official of Russia. He never had reason to fear me as an
individual; in fact, the individuality of Alexander Poubalov
long since disappeared in the person of the official
agent. Poubalov has no enmities, no friendships; all men
are hostile or friendly to him, as they are the enemies
or the adherents of the czar, whom God preserve! The
next step in the analysis is to suggest the nature of Mr.
Strobel's present enemies. You did not tell me so, but I
presume you are aware that when Mr. Strobel was younger
he permitted his generous sympathies to be enlisted in
what he would then have called 'the people's party' of
Russia. Without going into details with which every intelligent
person is more or less familiar, I will remind
you that, incidental to the so-called democratic movement
in Russia, was the organization of a secret society the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
avowed purpose of which was the disruption of the
empire."</p>

<p>Poubalov paused, and puffed at his cigarette deliberately.</p>

<p>"You want me to say something," cried Clara in desperation,
"and I don't know what to say."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the spy, suavely, "a woman of your
cleverness will not resent it when I tell you that you
misstate your difficulty. You could say much, perhaps,
but you are afraid to."</p>

<p>Clara's silence was an admission that Poubalov had
spoken correctly, and after giving her ample time to deny
his accusation, he continued:</p>

<p>"You are afraid&mdash;and again you will pardon plain language&mdash;that
you will involve your lover in fresh difficulties.
Let me point out again that, so far as his offenses against
the government of the czar are concerned, they were purely
political offenses, and he is therefore in a perfectly secure
asylum as long as he is on American soil, whether he
be simply a refugee or a naturalized citizen. You must
seek for his enemies, Miss Hilman, elsewhere than among
the representatives of Russian authority."</p>

<p>"You give me too much credit for cleverness," said
Clara, "for I cannot follow you."</p>

<p>"You know that the secret society to which I referred
adopted the term nihilism as a definition of its principles,
do you not? And you must know, even if Mr. Strobel
never told you so, that the Nihilists were bound by the
most awful oaths never to betray the secrets of their association."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that Mr. Strobel was a Nihilist?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; that was what I was driving at from the
beginning. It was for that he was compelled to fly from
Russia, and that is why he cannot return to his native
land. The government has done much to stamp out the
curse of nihilistic propaganda, and many members of the
society have fled. Some are in Switzerland, some in England,
others are here, here in Boston. Far from the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of their evil machinations, they cherish still their destructive
ambitions as applied to Russia; and, Miss Hilman,
they still keep watch on one another. It would fare ill
with any Nihilist in America should he venture to betray
his former associates in any way."</p>

<p>"I suppose I understand you now" said Clara, slowly.
"You mean that I must look for Ivan's enemies among the
Russian exiles who live in Boston."</p>

<p>"Or elsewhere in America."</p>

<p>"If he really were connected with them in Russia, he
would be the last man to betray them."</p>

<p>"Doubtless; but would they credit him with such loyalty?
May they not have imagined that, under certain
circumstances, he might be induced to betray them? And
may they not have conveyed such definite and fearful
threats that he found it necessary to disappear?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean by 'certain circumstances' his intended
marriage?"</p>

<p>"No. I may not mean anything. We shall see some day
whether I do or not."</p>

<p>"You speak in a constant succession of riddles. Why
not continue your frankness, and be strictly open with
me?"</p>

<p>Poubalov lit a fresh cigarette, and after a long scrutiny
of the ceiling, responded:</p>

<p>"That is not my way, Miss Hilman. I am sincerely trying
to suggest the clew to your difficult problem."</p>

<p>Clara took her own turn at reflection, and said at last:</p>

<p>"If Ivan felt obliged to disappear for a time, in order to
escape his enemies, he would have managed to let me
know."</p>

<p>"It would seem so," admitted Poubalov, rising; "and
that brings you to your last alternative."</p>

<p>"Wait," exclaimed Clara, imperatively; "you bring
me to the last alternative as if that were the end of my
difficulties. Suppose it to be true that some Russian exiles,
in a mistaken distrust of Mr. Strobel, have abducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
him. Can you not suggest how I am to proceed to prove
that and to rescue him?"</p>

<p>"I hope to be able to do so, Miss Hilman, in a short
time, a few days at most, and I assure you that I shall
henceforth give my undivided attention to searching for
Mr. Strobel."</p>

<p>Clara knitted her brows in painful perplexity.</p>

<p>"A woman situated as I am," she said presently,
"ought to be stirred by nothing but gratitude; but the one
thing I can think to say is, why do you interest yourself
so deeply in the matter?"</p>

<p>"Still distrustful," said Poubalov in his deepest tones.
"Miss Hilman, I might resort to sophistry and direct
deceit in answering your question. I might point out that
the newspapers have placed me, though not as yet by
name, in a disagreeable position from which it should be
my earnest desire to extricate myself. I might declare
that I was moved by friendship or admiration for Mr.
Strobel. But it does not please me to practice arts of
trickery with you. Public notoriety I care as little for as
for the fly that buzzes harmlessly about my head. I never
had friendship or admiration for Mr. Strobel, and I feel
neither sentiment now. Alexander Poubalov's one sentiment
is loyalty to his czar."</p>

<p>"You haven't answered the question."</p>

<p>"Because I cannot answer it without either deceit or
the betrayal of my trust. But I shall nevertheless use
every endeavor to find your lover. Will you care to hear
from me from time to time?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Clara, after a moment's thought; "certainly,
yes. I do thank you for speaking to me as you
have, and I wish I could trust you. I almost do trust
you."</p>

<p>"It would be too ungracious in me," responded Poubalov,
"not to wish that you could trust me, and not to hope
that some time in the near future you will find that in
this matter you can do so absolutely."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose it would be vain to ask you what you are
going to do?"</p>

<p>"As vain as for me to ask you to tell me all I would like
to know about Mr. Strobel."</p>

<p>"Mr. Poubalov," exclaimed Clara, earnestly, "there can
be no reason why I should withhold anything from you.
Your own argument proves that; and, besides, you know
more about Ivan's connection with the nihilistic movement
than I ever dreamed of. You perceive the distrust
that I cannot conquer, but you believe me, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Implicitly, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>"Then I assure you that, to my knowledge, Mr. Strobel
has not had anything to do with nihilistic propaganda in
this country for three years at least. He used to write
some on Russian topics, but he abandoned that when he
went into business, and&mdash;I may say, when he became
acquainted with me. I think I know all his friends, all
his associates, and among them all there is but one Russian,
a gentleman like himself."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear this," said Poubalov; "and now
I will see what I can do. I cannot act as I would in Russia,
but I can still accomplish something, I think. I hope to
have the honor of calling upon you soon. I leave it entirely
to you to speak of our conversation as you please, but I
will go out without disturbing Madame White and your
friend. Au revoir, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>The distinguished-looking Russian bowed and left the
room and immediately afterward Clara heard the outside
door close upon him.</p>

<p>When Litizki, the forlorn-looking tailor, mentioned
Poubalov's name, both Mrs. White and Louise Pembroke
exclaimed "That's it!" and both came forward as if their
anxiety were about to be dissipated at one stroke.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Mrs. White, eagerly.</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;" began Litizki fiercely; "no! I must not
speak. Let me go out, that I may watch him. He shall
lead me to Ivan Strobel. Do not tell him that I have been
here, do not mention my name."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me! it makes me more nervous than ever," said
Mrs. White, laying a hand on Litizki's arm to restrain
him. "Do you think, Mr. Litizki, that he has done anything
to Mr. Strobel?"</p>

<p>"Think!" exclaimed the little tailor who seemed on fire
with excitement, "it is the next thing to knowing! Not a
word, remember!"</p>

<p>He tip-toed his way through the hall as if it were night
and he were a thief, and cautiously opened the outside
door. He touched his hand dramatically to his lips as he
closed it behind him, leaving Mrs. White terrified and
Miss Pembroke bewildered.</p>

<p>Litizki, even in a tumult of rage and desperation, was
not a very impressive man to look at. It would have
seemed that his fury could be quelled by a gentle cuff
with the open hand, and that his whole being could be
snuffed out with a vigorous pinch; but if ever man was terribly
in earnest, he was, and a close observer might have
noted the danger signals in the formation of his head and
in the hang of his lips. This was a man who might be
stirred to such depths that his whole shallow nature
would be in commotion, when discretion would be cast off
like flecks of foam from an on-rushing wave; and then let
an enemy be wary, for even a slender arm, like that of the
little tailor, may strike a fatal blow!</p>

<p>It seemed a long, long time to Litizki that Poubalov continued
his conversation with Miss Hilman. He dared not
linger near the house lest the spy should see him from
a window, or emerge suddenly from the doorway and so
discover that eager eyes were directed to his movements.
Litizki slunk into one doorway after another, never staying
long in one, lest he be warned away with sufficient
outcry to alarm Poubalov, whose ear, he believed, was
acutely tuned to the slightest sounds, and who found
untoward significance even in the vagrant breeze.</p>

<p>At last the door opened, and Litizki dodged into an open
hall, only to flit out again as soon as he saw Poubalov turn
toward Somerset Street. Arrived there, he turned down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the hill, and then Litizki ran forward to the corner around
which he peered cautiously. It would not have surprised
him if his face had touched that of Poubalov as he did
so, for it would have seemed to him but natural that the
spy should think that he was followed and should wait
there for the purpose of trapping his adversary. But, no;
Poubalov was progressing calmly down the street, and
at Howard he again turned to the left.</p>

<p>Litizki ran after, fearful of losing his man in the more
crowded street, saw him cross Bulfinch into Bulfinch Place,
and finally open the door of a lodging house with a latch-key.</p>

<p>"So!" thought the tailor, noting the number of the
house and turning back, "he chooses his room within a
stone's throw of Ivan Strobel's, and then takes a roundabout
way to go from one house to the other. That is
like him. Alexander Poubalov could not be direct in conversation
or action even if he were intent upon a good
deed&mdash;which would be impossible."</p>

<p>The suggestion was so grotesquely absurd that Litizki
laughed and shuddered at once.</p>

<p>"Now," he reflected, "shall I tell the police where to
look for Ivan Strobel, or shall I consult with his lady?
I will go back and see her first."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A DANGEROUS MAN.</p>


<p>For some minutes after Poubalov left the house Clara
sat motionless, reviewing the strange discourse of the
Russian, trying to persuade herself one moment to trust
him, and the next impulsively throwing aside the theories
so finely spun from his innuendoes and circumlocutions.
She shuddered at the thought of Ivan in the hands of such
fanatics as she knew were included in the most rabid
enemies of Russian polity, and as promptly felt such a solution
of the mystery to be impossible. Equally impossible
seemed the solution that premised a fear on the part of
Ivan so great that he dared not let even his intended wife
know of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>Removed from the influence of Poubalov's magnetic
personality and his subtle arguments, Clara felt that it
was to him rather than to the Nihilists that she must look
for implacable hostility to Ivan. Yet why should Ivan,
resident in and prospective citizen of the United States,
fear him, an "official agent of a friendly government"?
Fear? That was not like the Ivan she knew and loved!
Was it not again impossible that her lover should have
been so stirred by fear of anybody or anything as to take
flight and conceal his hiding-place from her?</p>

<p>On the other hand, how could she know what influences
had been suddenly applied to Ivan to make him take
a seemingly indefensible if not impossible course? And
what was more impossible, in any of the suggested solutions,
than his very disappearance, which was a painful
fact, although hard to realize even after nearly twenty-four
hours had passed since the time set for his wedding?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>The dining-room door was softly opened, and Mrs.
White put in her head.</p>

<p>"Has he gone?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Clara, starting up as if she had been
aroused from sleep. "Come in."</p>

<p>Louise approached her cousin solicitously.</p>

<p>"We have had such a fright!" she said taking Clara in
her arms; "I didn't know whether to be more alarmed
when we could hear his deep voice than after the sound of
it had ceased altogether."</p>

<p>"Why should you have feared?" asked Clara; "you
couldn't suppose that I was in any danger in Mrs. White's
house, could you?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Louise, "but the air is full of excitement;
and while Mr. Poubalov was talking, another Russian
came in who is friendly to Ivan. Mrs. White says he
is a tailor, a very poor man whom Ivan befriended, and
an exile like himself. He recognized Poubalov's voice, and
declared positively that his presence here explained Ivan's
fate. He was terribly agitated and refused to stay, saying
that he must follow Poubalov. We couldn't tell what
to make of it."</p>

<p>This little narration came as a new shock to Clara. She
had told Poubalov that among all of Ivan's friends there
was but one Russian, and she had in mind, of course,
Paul Palovna. She had never heard of this tailor, and although
it might not follow that Ivan would count among
his friends a poor man whom he might have befriended,
was it not a reasonable inference that this poor man was a
Nihilist? and that if there were one brought to light, that
there might be many others whose identity would ever remain
unknown to her? Had she not heard how the great
body of the nihilistic society was made up of the poor?
and this man had recognized Poubalov! That was significant,
surely; but just what inference of value she should
draw from it was anything but clear.</p>

<p>While these thoughts and questions were chasing
through her brain, Litizki and Paul Palovna arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the house, coming from different directions. Paul approached
Clara with marked constraint.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, my friend," she said, extending her
hand; "I am quite strong and hopeful. I have read the
papers, all of them, and they do not disturb me. I cannot
thank you enough for what you did for me yesterday."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you speak so bravely," responded
Paul; "you mustn't feel indebted to me, however, for
Strobel is the best friend I ever had, and it would be
strange indeed if I did not try to find him. I suppose it is
almost unkind to ask if there is any news?"</p>

<p>"There is none exactly, and yet I have heard some
things that you can advise me about better than anybody
else."</p>

<p>"Miss Hilman," interposed Mrs. White, "this is Mr.
Litizki, the man Miss Pembroke was telling you about."</p>

<p>Clara, intent upon referring Poubalov's suggestions to
Paul, had not seen the little tailor come in. Now she turned
and confronted Litizki with mingled hope and alarm;
hope that this man, whose positive utterance had been reported,
might give her a definite clew; alarm lest he be
one of the most irreconcilable of revolutionists, a man
who would sacrifice friends and family for a cause that he
imagined just. Her doubts increased as she saw the wild
gleam in his small eyes, that lit up his sallow face and
made it glow with fierce intensity. Ivan had befriended
him; must she distrust him, too?</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you," she said with a quick resolution
to win this man, and she surprised the tailor and made
him speechless for the moment by grasping his hand
warmly. "You have come to tell me something about Mr.
Poubalov, or Mr. Strobel, or both?"</p>

<p>Litizki, embarrassed and awed by this queenly young
woman who looked into his eyes so searchingly and
withal so graciously, cleared his throat, shifted about on
his feet, and a faint tinge of red actually found its way
to his sunken cheeks.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered after a moment, catching his breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
with a gasp and swallowing as if he took oxygen into his
system by way of his stomach; "yes, Miss Hilman, about
both, if you please."</p>

<p>He paused, excitement and embarrassment making it
difficult to say anything coherently.</p>

<p>"Poubalov?" said Paul, whose brows had contracted
ominously when he heard the name, and who took advantage
of the pause to ask, "What Poubalov is that?"</p>

<p>"Can there be more than one who would hound a poor
Russian the world over?" rasped Litizki, turning upon
Paul, intense excitement blazing again in his usually
dull eyes; "it is none other than Alexander Poubalov,
spy, informer, traitor!"</p>

<p>The little tailor trembled visibly as he hissed these
words, and he turned to Clara as if to make certain that
they should impress her deeply.</p>

<p>"What, in the name of all that is right, does Poubalov
do here?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"Do?" cried Litizki; "does he ever do anything but
spy upon the poor? Ask what has he done here, and I will
tell you that he has captured our Strobel, and has him
bound in chains, waiting only a convenient and safe opportunity
to convey him from the country to the presence
of the little father<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and then, Siberia, or&mdash;&mdash;" and the
tailor drew his hand significantly across his throat.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Russian familiar name for the czar.</p></div>

<p>Clara observed Paul, not the tailor, during this extravagant
speech. Would Palovna, an intelligent man, free
from excitement, condemn and ridicule Litizki's assertions
as wild and imaginary? No; he listened gravely
and gave no sign that he discredited the tailor in the
least. Noticing Clara's inquiring look, Paul said:</p>

<p>"We Russians, Miss Hilman, are inclined to credit almost
any monstrosity in the way of crime, treachery
and violence to men like Alexander Poubalov. To us he
stands as guilty of anything with which he is charged
until he incontestably proves himself innocent."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>Clara's heart sank heavily, but she knew that she
could trust Paul.</p>

<p>"May I tell you something?" she asked, and he followed
her into the dining-room. There she hurriedly repeated
the substance of Poubalov's discourse, laying especial
stress upon his warning relative to distrustful
Nihilists.</p>

<p>"It's a splendid argument," said Paul when she had finished;
"I suppose you were attracted by his very frankness
in admitting that he is a spy? That was a characteristic
move. Mind you, I never had trouble with Poubalov;
I wouldn't know him if I saw him, but I know about him.
He is a very prince of spies, a past-master in the art of
deceit, and many, many shrewd men have been the victims
of his seeming candor. You may be sure he masks
some villainy beneath his frankness, for he never was
known to do a disinterested act."</p>

<p>"He spoke as if he were here upon some mission," suggested
Clara.</p>

<p>"Certainly, but he wouldn't tell you what that mission
was. That it had to do with Strobel is certain. I
don't want to alarm you unnecessarily, Miss Hilman, but
Poubalov is a most dangerous man. It may be well for us
that you have faced him, though we must necessarily
have discovered his presence soon, and to see him is to
suspect. We at least know where to look. Litizki is an
impressionable, excitable man, but he may be right, nevertheless.
I am sure that you can trust him, whether or not
there is anything in Poubalov's nihilistic suggestions.
And as to that, I don't believe there is&mdash;not with him
about. Plenty of false notions prevail about the Russian
revolutionists, and it would be to Poubalov's interest to
arouse dread of them in your mind. Anything to distract
attention and suspicion from himself."</p>

<p>They returned to the front room. Litizki had recovered
from his excitement, and was more like his customary,
depressed self, but though he spoke quietly it was with
bitter emphasis and strong conviction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "that Poubalov instigated if he
did not take part in the abduction of Mr. Strobel. I am
convinced that he has him now in hiding, and the question
only is whether we are to inform the police or take
action ourselves."</p>

<p>"The police," responded Paul, "would not proceed
against Poubalov on the strength of our suppositions. He
would intrench himself in his official position, and insist
on compliance with all forms of law; and during the delay,
if, indeed, he has Strobel in his power, he would spirit
him away."</p>

<p>"So I think," said Litizki, "and as he won't dare to
remove Strobel until the interest in his disappearance
dies down, unless he were openly attacked in the manner
you suggest, I intend, if Miss Hilman agrees, to hunt for
our friend in my own way. I shall do so to-night. I must
find him."</p>

<p>He looked inquiringly at Clara.</p>

<p>"I cannot say yes or no," she replied; "you are a friend
of Mr. Strobel's and you will do what you think best.
Only, let me know what you find."</p>

<p>There was a gleam of pleasure in Litizki's eyes, followed
by an expression of sullen determination as he responded:</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Lou," said Clara, "I think we had better go home
now. I am feeling very worn. If any of you hear the least
word, I wish you would come to see me."</p>

<p>As she prepared to leave she took occasion to whisper to
Paul:</p>

<p>"I do not know that I do right in encouraging Litizki.
My feeling is that the more there are at work and the
more various the methods, the greater is the chance of
success. May I leave it to you to prevent Litizki, if possible,
from any act that would be indiscreet, or worse?"</p>

<p>"I will do what I can," said Paul; "but he is, after all,
an irresponsible agent. I am inclined to think that good
will come of his investigation, whatever he does."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the luncheon hour when the young ladies reached
home, and Mr. Pembroke had arrived before them. His
face expressed painful anxiety as he greeted his niece.</p>

<p>"My poor child," he said, "you have heard everything,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I have heard a great deal, uncle," replied Clara, "and
appreciate your motives in withholding the paper from
me that published the wicked rumor that Ivan had eloped,
but you should have known me better. Do you suppose,
uncle dear, that that rumor disturbed me? I dismiss it
more lightly than anything that has been said."</p>

<p>"Poor child! poor child!" sighed Mr. Pembroke.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" asked Clara, sitting down
wearily. "Of course, I am sorrowful; nobody can realize
what I suffer; but I am confident that Ivan has done no
wrong, and I cannot believe that we shall not find him. I
have returned to rest, not to give up the search."</p>

<p>"Clara, my dear girl," said her uncle, tenderly, "you'd
best give it up. You have a great sorrow to bear, but I
know how brave you are. There is no occasion for further
search."</p>

<p>"No occasion! Uncle, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The detective assigned from headquarters to make an
investigation has been to see me."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! what did he say?"</p>

<p>"The worst possible, Clara. He is convinced that Strobel
went to New York, if not with Lizzie White, then to join
her there. It is the only possible explanation of his disappearance."</p>

<p>"No! no! you know nothing about it, and the detective
is a fool!" cried Clara.</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke was immensely surprised at this violent
outbreak, when he had expected tears, prostration, the
deepest grief. It occurred to him that perhaps his niece's
mind had been unsettled by her trouble. She sat looking
at him with blazing eyes, her face flushed, her foot nervously
patting the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are greatly excited, Clara," ventured her uncle,
gently.</p>

<p>"Tell me what the detective said!" retorted Clara, imperiously.</p>

<p>"He has found that a closed carriage, such as we know
Strobel took at the corner of Park and Tremont Streets,
halted at the Park Square Station shortly after that time.
The passenger was a young man who answered the description
of Strobel. He paid the driver, went into the station,
bought a ticket for New York, and immediately
took his place in the train. It is further known that Lizzie
White took a train from the same station at about the
same hour."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Clara, scornfully.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, is it not enough?"</p>

<p>"It is nothing, uncle, absolutely nothing. Has your detective
seen the driver of the closed carriage?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I suppose so."</p>

<p>"I must see the detective then. No, I am not going
now. After luncheon. I shall not risk failure by neglecting
to care for myself. Uncle dear," and she suddenly
melted and put her arms around the old gentleman's
neck, "forgive me, please, if I am impatient and hasty
with you. I know Ivan as you do not; I know this accusation
is not true. The detective has been mistaken, and I
shall show him so, and all the world besides."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke sighed sadly.</p>

<p>"Your loyalty, my dear," he said, "is deserving of a
better subject and a better fate."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.</p>


<p>Nothing would deter Clara from a trip to police headquarters
after luncheon, and, as in the forenoon, her
Cousin Louise accompanied her. As they entered the
building in Pemberton Square, they met the infirm old
man, Dexter, he who had arrived late at the church, he
whom Clara had interrupted in conversation with Mr.
Pembroke. He bowed to the young ladies with an attempt
at graciousness, and reached for the shapeless, soft
cap that covered his head, but he only succeeded in pulling
the visor awry, and he passed them, mumbling about
the weather.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said Clara, "that my trouble is making
me harsh toward everybody, but that old man seems to
me the most disagreeable and repulsive being I ever saw.
Who is he?"</p>

<p>"I only know that his name is Dexter," replied Louise;
"he has some business with papa, I believe."</p>

<p>Clara inquired for the detective who had been assigned
to the Strobel case, and after such delays as are naturally
incident to strangers making their first call at the offices
of the department, she was confronted by Mr. William
Bowker, a commonplace-looking individual, who said:</p>

<p>"Well, ladies, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I am Miss Hilman," replied Clara.</p>

<p>"Ah!" and Bowker raised his brows regretfully, "I informed
your uncle this forenoon, Miss Hilman, of what I
have done and found in the matter."</p>

<p>"He told me about it, but I couldn't be satisfied with a
report at second hand. Won't you tell me just what you
told him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be very unpleasant for you, Miss Hilman, and
if Mr. Pembroke has told you the result of my investigation,
that is really all there is to be said."</p>

<p>"I won't trouble you to repeat that a gentleman answering
the description of Mr. Strobel alighted from a closed
carriage at the Park Square Station, shortly after the accident
on Park Street and bought a ticket for New York, or
that Miss White took the same train. I am willing to take
it for granted that you have traced Miss White's movements
correctly. I want to know what makes you so certain
that the gentleman who took the train was Mr. Strobel?"</p>

<p>Detective Bowker stared at the young lady a moment;
it was his delicate way of expressing surprise.</p>

<p>"The description of the man and the time tallied with
Strobel and his accident," he answered, "to say nothing
of the reasons for his running away."</p>

<p>"Is that all, Mr. Bowker?"</p>

<p>"No, it ain't; that was what we found at first. Don't
it look reasonable&mdash;&mdash;" and he proceeded to theorize on
the matter until Clara checked him.</p>

<p>"I could have heard all that from half the people in
Boston," she said, "if I had paid any attention to the
rumor. I supposed professional detectives would base
their reports on something better than conjecture."</p>

<p>Bowker shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"What would you say," he asked with a little temper,
"if an acquaintance of Strobel's was to tell you that he
saw the gentleman buy his ticket and go to the train?"</p>

<p>"Have you such evidence as that? If so, who is it?"</p>

<p>"I can't answer the question, Miss Hilman. I have no
right to make public the workings of the department. I
expect to get further evidence this afternoon to prove
that Strobel eloped. It's by no wish of mine, you understand,
that I tell you these disagreeable things."</p>

<p>"You needn't apologize, Mr. Bowker. I came for information.
I understand, then, that you do not regard your
investigation as finished."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. Of course we want to clinch it."</p>

<p>"Have you seen the driver of the closed carriage?"</p>

<p>"No. We have no means of identifying him except recognition
by the man who drove the coupé. If a man
should walk in here and say that he drove the closed carriage,
we'd examine him, of course, but we've been unable
yet to find that man. The thing being in the papers,
it may happen&mdash;in fact, it's quite likely&mdash;that the missing
driver will turn up to-day. Cabmen are usually anxious
to please the department. I suppose the evidence of
the cabman would be satisfactory, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Quite, if I was satisfied that it was the man, and that
he told the truth."</p>

<p>"I guess you're hard to satisfy, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bowker," and Clara beamed on him with a smile
so sweet and radiant that he started with astonishment,
"I think you are working hard and as faithfully as you
know how to prove a theory which you formed early in
your investigations, even before you had Lizzie White's
flight to base it on. I shouldn't think you'd do that, you
know. Honestly, wouldn't you rather find out the truth,
even if it did upset your first theory?"</p>

<p>Bowker stared in undisguised discomfort.</p>

<p>"If you've got any facts," he said, "you'd ought to let
us have them. Of course we want to find out the truth.
What is it you know, or think of?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Mr. Bowker," responded Clara, rising,
and still bewildering him with her lovely smiles; "you
work along in your way and I'll work in mine. When I
learn that you've found anything worth considering, I may
take you into my confidence; I might even co-operate
with you. Good-afternoon."</p>

<p>No one was more amazed at Clara's coolness than her
Cousin Louise.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can do it, Clara," she said when
they were again in Pemberton Square.</p>

<p>"Do you realize," returned Clara, "what might happen
if I didn't do something of this kind? Somebody must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
stir everybody else up, or else the public will not only
come to believe that Ivan was false, but we shall never
find him. I may be making mistakes, but I don't believe
that detective will be content to stop where he is. He'll
look further, and the further he looks the more certainly
will he find that he has been working at a wrong theory.
Let's go somewhere and find a business directory."</p>

<p>They went to the parlor of a neighboring hotel, where
for an hour Clara busied herself making a list of all the
livery and hack stables in the city. Then she hired a cab,
and for hours the young ladies went from one to another
stable, Clara always with the same inquiry, seeking for
some trace of him whom for convenience she came to call
the "second driver."</p>

<p>There is no need to go into the details of her tedious
search. It was not concluded when evening came, and
she had to desist from sheer fatigue. She had found no
clew that promised the discovery of the one witness who
could certainly be of use to her.</p>

<p>From Mrs. White's Litizki went to his shop and toiled
patiently and methodically for two or three hours. He
hardly opened his lips during the whole time, but his
brain was busy with projects. That Poubalov was responsible
for the fate of Ivan Strobel did not admit of a shadow
of doubt; that he had concealed the young man in his
lodgings was not so certain, but Litizki deemed it altogether
probable. The spy would have plenty of money,
he could have put up at a hotel; why had he not done so?
Because, according to Litizki's reasoning, he had uses for
a lodging to which the public conveniences of a hotel could
not safely be bent. Distrustful of all men, the spy would
keep his prisoner under his own charge, and in a lodging-house
it would not be difficult to purchase the discreet
silence of a not too scrupulous landlady concerning a mysterious
co-tenant.</p>

<p>The more he thought about it the more firmly the idea
took possession of the tailor that Strobel was confined in
the Bulfinch Place lodging-house which Poubalov had entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
by means of a latch-key. If any one had suggested
to him the spy's arguments to the effect that as the agent
of a friendly government he could not venture, if he
would, to violate American law, Litizki would have
laughed, and that would have been very significant of his
immeasurable contempt for the argument, for it was not
in the memory of his associates that the tailor had ever
smiled. His nearest approach to it, in fact, was when he
manifested pleasure at the idea of being countenanced in
an investigation of Poubalov's doings in his own way. Respect
American law, indeed! Then would Poubalov be
other than he was, and the leopard might be expected to
change his spots.</p>

<p>Litizki hated Poubalov with all the concentrated venom
of his small nature, a nature that had known little of
good in the world save in Ivan Strobel's kindness, that had
felt the blows of tyranny and the stabs of treachery at the
hands of this same spy. A desire for vengeance had smoldered
long in his heart, and he had never expected that
any breeze of fortune would fan it into living flame; and
now, suddenly, it had burst forth a raging fire, and the
possibility of opportunity rose before his dull eyes as the
one glad hope of his wretched life. Poubalov in America!
Poubalov at his treacherous work against the one man
who had inspired Litizki with confidence and stirred his
affections! and he, Litizki, knew Poubalov's secret, knew
where he could lay hands upon him! Fate must have
placed him there in order that Litizki's vengeance might
be the more complete.</p>

<p>The tailor laid down his tools and bent his head upon
his hands. Poubalov must be checkmated, Strobel rescued;
and if in accomplishing this end, the spy should be&mdash;Well,
what then?</p>

<p>Litizki put on a long coat with a high collar that he
turned up about his ears, and a soft hat that he pulled
down over his eyes. At the foot of the stairs that led to
his shop he met Paul Palovna.</p>

<p>"Hello, Litizki," exclaimed the young man, "where in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the world are you going rigged out as if it were winter?"</p>

<p>The grotesque little figure looked sourly up at the inquirer
and replied:</p>

<p>"I am going to begin my work."</p>

<p>"See here, Litizki," said Paul, seriously, "you mustn't
do anything rash. I was just coming to see you to give
you warning. Poubalov is dangerous and very clever.
Don't get yourself into trouble, and don't spoil all
chance of trapping him, if he has really got hold of Strobel,
by any premature act."</p>

<p>The little tailor reflected.</p>

<p>"For myself," he answered presently, "nothing matters.
I will be careful, Paul Palovna, as careful as man
can be not to compromise any chances. I shall act for myself
alone. Nobody sends me, nobody influences me. If I
succeed, we shall all rejoice; if I fail"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders significantly&mdash;"I will be the only loser. I promise
you not to be rash, Paul Palovna, for the sake of
noble Ivan Strobel and his beautiful lady."</p>

<p>Then he moved away, and Palovna knew hardly
whether to smile at his ludicrous make-up, or shudder at
the purpose that unquestionably lurked in his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I hope good may come of it!" sighed Palovna.</p>

<p>Litizki went to Bulfinch Place, and shrinking as far as
possible into his long coat, walked along on the sidewalk
opposite Poubalov's house. Yes, there the villain was,
calmly reading a newspaper! One flight from the ground,
front room. At the side of the room was a smaller one
over the hall. Litizki knew the arrangement of the houses
in that vicinity, and the blinds of that room were closed.
Perhaps, though, the prison chamber would be in some
more remote part of the house. Time and the night would
tell.</p>

<p>The tailor went to the corner of Bowdoin Street, and
stood there, unmindful of the curious glances of passers
until he saw Poubalov leave the lodging-house. It was
just possible that the spy had his prisoner concealed elsewhere,
and was now going to him. Litizki followed. It occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to him that now might be the time to get into the
house on some pretext and make a search, but he dismissed
the thought as ruinous. If Strobel were there, the
landlady would be paid to be watchful during Poubalov's
absence. No; the night was the time when nobody would
be watching, and when every corner in the house could be
searched from cellar to garret.</p>

<p>Poubalov went to State Street, and entered the bank
where Strobel had been employed. He brushed past
Litizki when he emerged, but apparently did not see him.
The tailor followed him from one place to another, waited
under a hotel window for an hour while the spy was dining,
saw him into a theatre and eventually back to his
lodgings, where he arrived at about eleven o'clock. It was
evident that he went directly to bed, for the light in his
room was extinguished very shortly after he went in.</p>

<p>Litizki then went to a cheap restaurant, where he appeased
his appetite and drank several cups of bad tea. It
was after midnight before he left the place, and his one
wish was that he had a dark lantern. To make up for his
lack, he was plentifully supplied with matches.</p>

<p>A printer, whom Litizki knew by sight, lived in the
house adjoining the one where Poubalov lodged. The
tailor knew that he ordinarily arrived home at one
o'clock. He was on time this night, and as he turned into
the tiny yard before the building, Litizki stepped down
from the doorway.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come," he said, "I left my key in the
room and I can't rouse anybody by ringing."</p>

<p>"No," responded the printer with a laugh, "they don't
get up for anybody. How long you been living here?"</p>

<p>"Only a few days."</p>

<p>The door was opened, and both men went upstairs. The
printer, with a cheery "good-night," entered a room on the
second landing. Litizki continued to the top floor, and
thence through a skylight to the roof. Fortune was, indeed,
favoring him. He had supposed the skylight would
be raised for the sake of ventilation. There had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
doubt whether the steps leading to it would be in place.</p>

<p>He cared little whether the skylight on the adjoining
roof would be found open and the steps in place, or not;
he would get in in any event. Both were in just the condition
most favorable to his project, and a moment later
Litizki had struck a match and was peering about in an
empty room on the top floor of Poubalov's lodging house.</p>

<p>The little tailor exulted more and more as he crept down
the stairs after examining every room. Not a sleeper
had been awakened, not a door had been found locked.
He would search the whole house before trying the door
to the hall room adjoining Poubalov's. That would be
found locked. He had no doubt he should pick the lock,
for he had skeleton keys in his pocket, and if not&mdash;a vigorous
shove and he would burst it open. What cared he
for details at the very end of his search?</p>

<p>He had come to the floor above the spy's room. Here,
as before, every door was unlocked, most of the rooms
empty. He had just extinguished a match preparatory to
descending further, when from somewhere out of the
darkness heavy hands were laid upon him and he was
borne to the floor. Another instant and a hand was pressed
upon his mouth and there was a dazzling flash of light
from a dark lantern held over him.</p>

<p>Litizki saw the cruel eyes of Alexander Poubalov glaring
down, and then the slide of the lantern was closed
again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">LITIZKI'S LESSON.</p>


<p>There had been no scuffle and almost no noise as the
tailor fell to the floor, but one of the chamber doors
opened, nevertheless, and a startled voice asked: "What's
that?"</p>

<p>"Sorry you've been disturbed," said Poubalov; "a
friend of mine, with a little more of a load than he could
manage, has stumbled. That's all. I will look out for
him."</p>

<p>The inquirer went back to bed grumbling, and as soon
as the door closed Poubalov whispered in Russian: "Will
you keep quiet, or shall I have to quiet you?" and he removed
his hand from Litizki's mouth.</p>

<p>"It's all one to me, Alexander Poubalov," muttered the
tailor, and, feeling the pressure removed, he rose to his
feet. Still speaking Russian, the spy remarked:</p>

<p>"You are so good at finding your way in the dark that I
will not pull the slide of my lantern. I should dislike, for
your sake, to have you recognized. Go down and enter my
room."</p>

<p>Litizki felt for the banister, and, guided by it, walked
down the flight and opened the door, as directed, into his
captor's room. When Poubalov came in he closed and
bolted the door, then opened the lantern and let its rays
fall on Litizki from head to feet, and head again, as if he
were curiously studying the make-up. He laughed softly
at last and said:</p>

<p>"There's a chair just back of you. Sit down."</p>

<p>The tailor sank into it, and Poubalov lit the gas. In the
general light Litizki saw that the spy was fully dressed
save for his coat, and that the folding bed which was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
feature of the furniture had not been let down. Poubalov
noticed Litizki's glance and understood:</p>

<p>"No, my friend," he said suavely, "I did not go to bed.
I expected you, and sat up to receive you."</p>

<p>Litizki groaned. Until then he had hoped desperately
that even as a prisoner he would be able to accomplish
something; now, convinced that the spy had prepared
for his coming, he realized that his effort had been in
vain. The awful sense of the unshakable power this man
represented and wielded came over him as it did in those
gloomy days in Russia when he had to choose between
voluntary exile and certain banishment.</p>

<p>Poubalov drew a chair to a little table in the middle of
the room, and sat down opposite the tailor.</p>

<p>"Nicholas Litizki," he said, "you have surprised and
grieved me! I would not have supposed that even a residence
of several years in America could have made you
forget that Alexander Poubalov never takes a step until
he is thoroughly prepared for it. I, who hardly know
what the word emotion means, am almost hurt. Surely it
must be that contact with republican institutions deadens
a man's sensibilities and affects his memory."</p>

<p>Litizki's small eyes had been fixed upon those of his adversary
from the beginning. They had relapsed to their
customary dull expression, but they glowed faintly with
new life, for, the first edge of his disappointment dulled,
he recalled the two great purposes for which he had invaded
the house: vengeance and the rescue of Ivan Strobel.
Neither purpose might be lost, and if he must forego
or postpone vengeance, he would not prejudice what
means others might have at command for saving his benefactor.</p>

<p>"Poubalov," said the tailor, "I am an American citizen."</p>

<p>"I bow to your discretion," responded the spy, "but I
knew it. You think to hide behind the generous skirts of
your adopted country's goddess. Good! I admit the efficacy
of the refuge, for the accredited agent of the czar&mdash;whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
God preserve, Nicholas Litizki&mdash;will do nothing in
a friendly country in violation of that country's laws. But
see, my friend, what a tower of strength a proper respect
for the law becomes: I not only knew you were coming,
but I knew what you were coming for, and I need not say
that I knew what way you would take. I have kept within
the law, and yet I found out all about you and your associates
before I had been in Boston&mdash;no matter how long.
Poor fellow! did you really think that Poubalov's eyes did
not penetrate your flimsy disguise? I am sorry, Litizki;
your patience and devotion would fit you for service in
the holy cause of the czar, and it is not at all adapted to
pursuing the steps of honest men."</p>

<p>"You do not frighten me," interposed Litizki; "I know
your superlative cunning and your crooked ways. Your
speech nauseates me. 'Honest men!' Bah!"</p>

<p>"We won't dispute over trifles, then. I simply call to
your attention the fact that you unlawfully invade a
dwelling-house, prowling about like a common thief and
thus place yourself unreservedly in my power. Of course,
Nicholas Litizki did not enter here to commit theft.
He came to find his friend, Ivan Strobel."</p>

<p>"It is a lie, Alexander Poubalov! I sought him not."</p>

<p>"You know whether it is a lie, or not. So do I. Therefore
we will not argue the matter. Well, what are you going
to do now that you are here?"</p>

<p>Litizki boiled with futile rage. He was trapped not
only literally as Poubalov's prisoner, but he felt how
weak he was in any contest of words with this shrewd
master of deceit. He had spoken truly in telling Paul Palovna
that it mattered not what became of him, and although
those words were uttered under the influence of
a desire for vengeance that constant dwelling upon had
turned to conviction that he would succeed, he now felt
them to be as true, for he despaired, as he had been despairing
for years, of accomplishing anything that would
be worth the doing. Why had he presumed to undertake
the hopeless task of outwitting Poubalov? He saw how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
wildly foolish had been his course, but his conviction remained
unshaken.</p>

<p>"Have it so, then," he hissed; "respect for law is not in
your character. You have unlawfully taken possession of
Ivan Strobel."</p>

<p>"Yes?" responded Poubalov quietly; "you are very
sure of that?"</p>

<p>"I know it, yes; I did come here to find him, to liberate,
ay, to kill you if need be!"</p>

<p>"Indeed! the same, familiar antagonism to the authority
of Russia, I suppose. The Russian agent is to you like
the red flag to the bull. Yes, very interesting. Well, Litizki?"</p>

<p>"Alexander Poubalov!" exclaimed the tailor, rising and
speaking with all his long-treasured bitterness, "you have
Ivan Strobel, an American citizen, in your power; you restrain
him illegally of his liberty, with what purpose it
matters not. I, as an American citizen, demand that you
release him."</p>

<p>Poubalov looked with mock admiration at the fierce but
grotesque figure before him, and said:</p>

<p>"Good! very good! I am not certain but that demand
is good law. I shall have to think of it. When, Nicholas
Litizki?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tolerate your smart language," returned Litizki;
"give him up now. It will be worse for you if you
fool with me. You threw me down in the dark because I
was taken unawares. In the light I can make my own
fight, Alexander Poubalov! Come! Ivan Strobel is in that
room, behind that door, and if you have not stopped his
ears as you have gagged his mouth and bound his limbs,
he hears my voice now and knows it. I should be less
than man should I not take even a desperate step to rescue
him, my friend, my benefactor!"</p>

<p>Even to the cynical spy the grotesqueness of the little
tailor's figure and make-up disappeared in the exaltation
up to which his emotions bore him. He took one determined
stride toward the door to the little hall room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nicholas Litizki," said Poubalov, softly.</p>

<p>The tailor turned, such was the compelling power of
that deep voice, and for the instant his progress was
checked. Poubalov had extended one arm upon the table
and his hand was toying with a revolver.</p>

<p>"I believe you, my friend," remarked the spy, hardly
looking toward the tailor at first, but later concentrating
his gleaming eyes upon him, "I believe you when you
say by actions if not by words that you would die for
your friend, and that you do not care what becomes of
you. But you have some degree of cleverness, Litizki.
We learned that years ago. Listen, then, just a moment
before you lay hand upon that door. It is locked, Litizki.
Before you could open it I could put a bullet through
your heart. Would I not dare? What should a peaceable
lodger not do to a man who stealthily enters his house by
night? Who would disbelieve me if I should calmly report
to the police that you came as a burglar, and that I
shot at you in protection of property and life? Suppose,
however, that I prefer to avoid a disturbance. Before
you could more than wrench the knob of that door once, I
could pierce your heart silently."</p>

<p>Poubalov rose and stood towering over Litizki, a knife
glistening in his right hand.</p>

<p>"You know something of my resources," he continued,
"and whether I would be likely to find difficulty in disposing
of your lifeless body. Why! you have come so
secretly that you and I alone know of your whereabout.
We would then have another disappearance to add to the
Strobel mystery, but one that would not be half as interesting,
Litizki, not half."</p>

<p>"You have killed Ivan Strobel!" whispered Litizki,
shrinking away.</p>

<p>"In that inference," said Poubalov, contemptuously, as
he laid his weapons on the table and resumed his seat,
"your madness reaches its climax and you will speedily
recover. You will not go to that door now. You see how
useless it would be. Live, and you may yet see your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
friend, may yet assist in liberating him. Understand me,
Nicholas Litizki: I have not come to this country for
nothing. I have a mission to perform, and nothing shall
prevent me from performing it, and in my own way."</p>

<p>"You will then keep Strobel a prisoner," muttered Litizki,
"until you have wrung from him by cruelty what
you have come for?"</p>

<p>"I shall perform my mission. Now it would be perfectly
easy for me to remove you, for you are making
yourself an obstacle, a slight one, to my plans. It pleases
me better, however, that you should live, and you may
yet be an assistance to me. I will show you to the street
door whenever you feel ready to depart."</p>

<p>Litizki shot a glance full of evil at his captor, but Poubalov
ignored it, and calmly lighted the inevitable cigarette.</p>

<p>"Very well, Alexander Poubalov," said Litizki after a
moment, "you may let me go, but expect no gratitude
from me. I know only too well that you think to serve
your foul purposes by my liberty, but, weak as I am, I
shall not rest until Strobel is restored to us or his fate
made known, and even after that I shall pursue you!
You teach me a lesson, Poubalov, a hard one, but I shall
learn it."</p>

<p>"I hope you will. Life will be easier if you do. Must
you go now? Permit me," and with a fine pretense at
courtesy he unbolted the door and accompanied Litizki to
the street door, which he also opened.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Nicholas Litizki," he whispered as he
withdrew again into the house.</p>

<p>It was Litizki's purpose to go at once to the house where
Paul Palovna lodged, rouse him, and tell him his experience,
with all the admissions that Poubalov had seemed
to make, and all the inferences that were to be drawn
from his remarks and innuendoes; but as he hurried along
in the cool night air he felt as if something were leaving
him. He slackened his pace, halted irresolutely, went on a
few steps, and at last leaned heavily against a building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and struck his hand angrily against his brow, muttering:</p>

<p>"Fool, fool!"</p>

<p>What was this sense of loss but a relief from the dominating
influence of Poubalov's stronger personality?
There, with all his desperation, even at the height of his
exaltation, when he seemed to tread the border lands of
heroism, he had halted at a single word from the spy. He
had stood and listened to threats and sophistry, and had
been moved by the one and convinced by the other.</p>

<p>No! he could not tell all this to Palovna, or to any
other person except Strobel; to him, if he should ever return,
he would make a full confession of his defeat. For
the present he must keep it to himself, and if he would
still do something to effect his vengeance and rescue
Strobel, he must work in secret. And as he reflected that
it was just this course that Poubalov undoubtedly expected
him to take, he groaned and slunk abashed and
mortified to his lonely room.</p>

<p>In the early morning, without waiting to read newspapers,
or submit to interviews from reporters, should they
call again at the house, Clara and Louise set forth to finish
their search for the "second driver." Again they had
a tedious, fruitless experience. Now and again it seemed
momentarily as if they had come upon a clew to the man,
but Clara's keen questions invariably brought them to the
same disappointing end. By noon they had visited every
livery stable in Boston.</p>

<p>"Don't think me unkind, Clara," ventured Louise, "but
I fear we ought to give this up. I don't know that I can
say just why, for I sympathize with you as deeply as ever,
and, like you, I believe in Ivan; but somehow I fear."</p>

<p>"There are the stables in Cambridge and Somerville,"
responded Clara, absently; "we haven't been there. Forgive
me, dear! I didn't mean to ignore what you said.
We are both tired. I had meant to call at Mrs. White's
before returning, but we will go home and rest, and see if
fresh thinking will help us. There may be some word at
home by this time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>There was, indeed, some word at home. The servant
reported that Detective Bowker had called and would be
glad to see Miss Hilman, should she care to go downtown
during this afternoon; and there were many letters from
friends who had learned of her trouble. All except one
were more or less sympathetic, but in more than one
there was a veiled remonstrance against her taking such
a vigorous and public part in the case.</p>

<p>The exception was unsigned and without date. It read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If Miss Hilman insists on being convinced with her own eyes that
her 'lover' has been false, if she needs more proof to cause her to
withdraw from the ridiculous attitude she has assumed, why doesn't
she go to New York and find Lizzie White? The writer is certain that
she would return fully satisfied."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="center">CORROBORATIVE DETAIL.</p>


<p>Clara had not come sufficiently in contact with the evil
side of human nature to ignore an anonymous letter. She
felt all the contempt for the writer that he or she deserved,
and she spurned the suggestion contained in the
letter as utterly unworthy of a moment's attention. Yet
the sting was there. She might ignore the letter to all appearances,
and yet not be able to forget it. The cruelty of
the writer was what she felt, not the force of the blow.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand," she said, laying the letter down
and taking a newspaper, "how a person can go out of his
way for the sole purpose of doing an unkind thing."</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" asked Louise, stopping on her way
out of the room.</p>

<p>Clara started to show her the letter, but, overcome by a
sense of repugnance for it, answered:</p>

<p>"Let it pass until after luncheon. We shall have a great
deal to talk of then."</p>

<p>So Clara was left alone with the newspapers, and she
read them with amazement and consternation. At the
very first there was a little relief at finding no flaring
headlines on the first page, for she had no enjoyment in
the notoriety that the case thrust upon her. She bore it
simply as one of the unavoidable features of the situation.
As she searched the first paper, the relief vanished,
and in its place came a growing wonder. The reports of
the abandoned wedding had been set forth in complete
detail with every expansion that fertile brains could suggest,
as if every city editor had said to his reporter,
"We'll stand all you can write." It had been the important
news feature of the day, and to Clara it had seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
as if every newspaper in the city had undertaken to solve
the mystery. Where, then, was the long account of the
second day's developments?</p>

<p>Tucked obscurely away in the middle of a page devoted
to a miscellaneous assortment of news, she found at last
a few paragraphs setting forth the conclusions of the detective
bureau, that there was no financial irregularity to
be attributed to Mr. Strobel, and that the missing man
had undoubtedly eloped with Lizzie White. Miss Hilman's
health was reported to be good, and it was noted that
she had taken a personal hand in the investigation with
every appearance of confidence in the loyalty of her betrothed.</p>

<p>Clara found longer reports in the other papers, and the
one that had published the first intimation of the elopement,
continued to make it the sensation of the hour,
but it was a labored effort, devoted quite as much to exploiting
its own enterprise in beating the other papers as
to setting forth the news.</p>

<p>So, then, the community, of which the newspapers were
the reflection, had contentedly accepted the first solution
that offered, and all her work had gone for nothing, worse
than nothing, for she found herself pictured as a pitiable
victim to her lover's faithlessness. The very fact that the
reporters refrained from bringing out the picture of her
misery in strong colors was evidence of the sincerity with
which they wrote. They were satisfied that Ivan had
eloped! To tell how loyally she had clung to him would
be to put her in a ridiculous light before all readers.</p>

<p>The tears that came to Clara's eyes were angrily dashed
away at first, but they would flow, and after a moment she
gave full vent to them. Her experience was one that
comes only to those who have to suffer such great calamities
that for the time all life seems to be centered upon
them, and the awaking to the cold fact that all life runs
along just as before, and the great calamity speedily becomes
an event of yesterday, is almost as hard to bear as
the original shock. This awakening with Clara was coincident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
to a fresh determination to continue her search.
The world might laugh if it chose to be so cruel; she believed
in her lover and would yet find him.</p>

<p>The bell had rung for luncheon, and drying her eyes,
Clara went into the dining room. Her uncle was already
at the table. His greeting was constrained but not lacking
in affection and sympathy.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be better, Clara," he said
gently after they had exchanged a few words, "to withdraw
for a while from public view? I am afraid you are
doing no good, and I will not conceal from you that I regard
your loyal search as hopeless. I am getting to be an
old man, and I have seen a great deal of the world, as we
reckon it by the human beings who populate it. This
blow that has fallen upon you has fallen on others before
your time, and it will fall again. This that seems to you
incredible has been no less incredible in the past&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, please, uncle," interrupted Clara; "I cannot
draw comparisons, and if I could they would be valueless.
I must judge my affair by its own circumstances
alone. I believe Ivan has done no wrong, and it is
nothing less than my duty to him and myself to right the
wrong that has been done to him."</p>

<p>"But tell me, my dear child, is there anything in the
situation that promises a solution other than that found
by the detectives and the reporters?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, there is," replied Clara in a low tone, "and
I am glad the reporters have not found the clew, and I am
not sorry that Mr. Bowker missed it, too. I will tell you
about it."</p>

<p>"Papa," said Louise, coming into the room at this moment,
"Mr. Dexter has called. I was coming downstairs
when the bell rang, and I answered it. I showed him into
the library."</p>

<p>"I wish he would confine his calls to the office," exclaimed
Mr. Pembroke, impatiently. "You will have to
excuse me, though, for I am obliged to see him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid papa is having a serious time with his
business," said Louise, after he had gone.</p>

<p>"Everything comes at once, doesn't it?" responded
Clara; "I am so sorry! He wants me to give up trying to
find Ivan, dear. It hurts me to displease uncle, but what
would you do? I think he would like to have me go away
for a time."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think that! I am sure he feels toward you
as if you were his own daughter."</p>

<p>"I am sure he does, Lou. A father couldn't be more affectionate
and kind; but in this matter, how can I yield
to his wishes? He does not know."</p>

<p>"Do you mean about Mr. Poubalov?"</p>

<p>"Partly, but I had more in mind that no one could know
Ivan's character as well as I do."</p>

<p>Louise thought of her own budding love. If Ralph Harmon
were under suspicion, could she fail to defend him?
Could she think of him as other than honorable and faithful?</p>

<p>A servant passed through the room, and left the door in
the hall carelessly ajar. Neither of the young ladies noticed
it.</p>

<p>"Clara," said Louise, "I should try to do just as you
are doing, but I know I could not be so brave. I think if
you should tell uncle about Mr. Poubalov it might make
him feel better."</p>

<p>"I intend to do so," replied Clara, "and would have
done so last evening if he had been at home."</p>

<p>They were interrupted by Mr. Pembroke's voice. He
had stepped from the library into the hall, and was speaking
with ill-suppressed anger.</p>

<p>"I won't listen to anything you have to say on the matter,"
he said, "and I will ask you to confine your talks to
me to business matters; and when you must see me, go
to the office."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted old Dexter in reply, "she'll make you
as ridiculous as she makes herself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dexter," exclaimed Mr. Pembroke, "I think you're
the worst villain unhung!"</p>

<p>"H'm, h'm, h'm," muttered Dexter, "you're a fool, Mat
Pembroke. I think you're a fool!"</p>

<p>The front door closed loudly and Mr. Pembroke strode
into the dining-room, where the young ladies were looking
at each other with astonished eyes. Mr. Pembroke
was flushed, and he bit his lip with added vexation as he
noticed that his daughter and niece had heard the last
words of his conversation with Dexter.</p>

<p>"I am sorry&mdash;&mdash;" he began, his voice still shaking with
anger. He did not complete his remark, but sat down and
tried to eat.</p>

<p>After a moment Clara rose and put her arms softly
about his neck.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, too, uncle dear," she said, "that you have
so much trouble about me. Of course that vile man was
speaking of me."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke shuddered violently at her first touch.
He released her arms abruptly and stood up.</p>

<p>"No, don't!" he said with an expression of the deepest
pain; "you continue your search in your own way, child.
Don't mind about me or anybody else, least of all that&mdash;that
meddlesome Dexter."</p>

<p>"I was going to tell you some of the information I
learned yesterday, uncle."</p>

<p>"No, no! no, no! I don't want to hear it&mdash;that is, not
now. Forgive me, child; I am disturbed by business matters
and cannot attend to it now. This evening if you like.
Good-by."</p>

<p>He hastened from the room, more agitated than when
he had come in.</p>

<p>"It's a shame," said Clara, bitterly, "that any one who
is in trouble has to annoy all those who are near to her."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't think of it that way, dear," responded
Louise; "papa is as sympathetic as can be, and I am sure
that when he gets over his anger at this Mr. Dexter's interference,
there will be nothing to regret. He said himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
you know, that he would talk with you this evening."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall have something definite to tell him
then," said Clara. "Will you go downtown with me again
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>Of course she would, and in due time, therefore, the
young ladies were again at police headquarters. Detective
Bowker was evidently highly pleased with himself, although
he manfully tried to suppress any signs of triumph.</p>

<p>"I called at your house this forenoon, Miss Hilman," he
said, "to inform you that the driver of the closed carriage
has been found."</p>

<p>"What does he say?" asked Clara eagerly.</p>

<p>"He corroborates what I told you yesterday."</p>

<p>"Does he say that he drove Mr. Strobel to the Park
Square Station?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just as I told you."</p>

<p>"Can I see him?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you will be able to do so. He is not
here now. He has gone about his work, but I can have
him here at any time, or he will call on you. He suggested
that himself when I told him that you would be pretty
likely to doubt his story."</p>

<p>"I should like to see him," said Clara, her voice faint
and tremulous in spite of herself. "When did you find
him, Mr. Bowker?"</p>

<p>"Well, as to that," replied the detective, reluctantly,
"Billings came in here early this morning. You know I
said that might happen."</p>

<p>"Yes. What stable does he drive for?"</p>

<p>"What stable?" echoed Bowker with his stare of surprise;
"why should you ask that, Miss Hilman?"</p>

<p>"Because I have visited every stable in Boston to find
whether any employee could have been driving a closed
carriage along Park Street at the hour when the wheel of
Mr. Strobel's coupé came off."</p>

<p>"Whew! you did mean business, didn't you?" exclaimed
Bowker with evident admiration. "It's a pity you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
had such a time of it. Billings drove his own carriage. He
wasn't connected with any of the stables."</p>

<p>"I am glad to know that my search did not fail
through any lack of thorough inquiry," said Clara, and
she felt her courage reviving. "Will you send word to
this Mr. Billings that I would like to see him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. When shall I tell him to call?"</p>

<p>"Any time this evening. And, Mr. Bowker, can you not
give me the name of the man who said he saw Mr. Strobel
buy a ticket for New York?"</p>

<p>"I cannot do so. The fact is, we haven't the name. I
expected to get it, honestly I did, for I heard that Strobel
was recognized in the station by a friend; but that friend
hasn't turned up; and, to tell you the plain truth, we
don't think it necessary to inquire for him."</p>

<p>"It seems to me&mdash;&mdash;" began Clara, stopping and reflecting.
She was going to protest against the imperfect character
of the investigation, but she thought better of it.
This detective unquestionably had no interest to find other
than the truth, and with his low conceptions of character,
due doubtless to his frequent contact with criminals, it
would be but natural for him to see no other explanation
for Ivan's disappearance than the one to substantiate
which he had obtained a certain amount of evidence. If
even her good uncle were disposed to view the idea of the
elopement as a possibility, nay, as a probability, what better
could be expected of one to whom Ivan was merely a
man like other men? And the evidence of the "second
driver" which was undoubtedly straightforward&mdash;&mdash; Perhaps
Ivan had gone to New York. How could she tell?
Not with Lizzie White, of course, but&mdash;&mdash; She would talk
with the driver.</p>

<p>"I shall be greatly obliged," she concluded, "if you will
send me word should any new development turn up. I
don't suppose I can expect you to pay any further attention
to the case."</p>

<p>"We may hear from New York at any time," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Bowker; "the police there are on the lookout for Strobel,
and if we hear anything I will let you know."</p>

<p>Louise tucked her arm affectionately within Clara's,
and asked:</p>

<p>"Where now, dear?"</p>

<p>"We will go to Mrs. White's," responded Clara, drearily.
Her faith was yet undisturbed, but the mystery
seemed the darker, for if the wily Russian had had to do
with Ivan's departure, how much harder it would be to
find him in New York than in Boston! Then, had he gone
voluntarily, might it not be possible that he did not wish
her to search for him? Surely he would write if he could.
With that thought, and a renewed conviction that Ivan
was somehow constrained of his liberty, she arrived at
Mrs. White's house.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to see you," cried the landlady, "with all
this talk in the papers. I have heard from Lizzie. See!
Here is the letter."</p>

<p>She handed a sheet of paper to Clara. It was not a long
letter, but what little there was was rambling in style. It
was dated from Second Avenue, New York, and stated
that the writer had found a new home.</p>

<p>"I should be happy," she wrote, "if it wasn't for the
way I had to go. But there wasn't any other way. After
a while I shall tell you all about it."</p>

<p>Clara's quick perceptions told her that any person with
the elopement explanation in his head would see a significance
in these words that could not fail to reflect unfavorably
upon Ivan.</p>

<p>"Mrs. White," she said tremulously, "you won't show
this letter to reporters, or detectives, or anybody else, will
you?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">STRANGE EXIT OF POUBALOV.</p>


<p>"I had already shown it to Mr. Bowker," replied Mrs.
White, anxiously; "I thought it might convince him that
Lizzie had nothing to do with the disappearance of Mr.
Strobel."</p>

<p>"It didn't convince him," said Clara, bitterly; "but no
matter. May I copy Miss Lizzie's address?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Are you going to write to her?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. Have you written yet?"</p>

<p>"I haven't had time, but I shall do so this afternoon. Is
there something you would like to have me say?"</p>

<p>Clara was intent with her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Mrs. White," she said presently, "if you write to-night,
could you omit any reference to Mr. Strobel?"</p>

<p>"Land sakes!" exclaimed the good lady; "whatever
should I write about then? With Lizzie's name in the
papers, and everybody believing that she ran away with
Mr. Strobel, what should I say?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be hard to ignore it altogether, but
couldn't you omit saying anything of the rumors that
have connected their names?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'll try to, Miss Hilman, but Lizzie will have to
know about it some time."</p>

<p>"Certainly, when you write to-morrow you can say
what you please about it. Just for to-day I wish you
wouldn't. I'll come down early to-morrow morning, and
perhaps I will be able to tell you a great deal more than
you know now, more than any of us know."</p>

<p>"I do hope you will hear something definite," said Mrs.
White, "for you can't tell how much easier I am to know
that Lizzie's settled somewhere, that she's alive and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
home. If you only knew that Mr. Strobel was sick in a
hospital, now, it would be better, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is so dreadful as uncertainty," replied Clara;
"you'll be very careful what you write then?"</p>

<p>"As for that, Miss Hilman, I don't see that I need to
write at all to-day. It's only a day more, and if you say it
won't make any difference to you what I say to-morrow,
I'll put it off till then if you like."</p>

<p>"I should be so much obliged! Have you seen Mr. Litizki
to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, nor the dark gentleman, either. Mr. Litizki's shop
is not far from here, if you'd like to see him."</p>

<p>Clara inquired the way, and soon after the young ladies
set out for the little tailor's place of business.</p>

<p>Litizki was his own master in business, and he employed
two or more fellow-countrymen as assistants, the
number varying with the demands of his enterprise. On
this day there were several men in the shop, but they were
not there as workmen. Most of them had come to talk
with Litizki about the Strobel case. He was not very communicative,
but that was his way. Nevertheless he had
some things to say, and for this reason his acquaintances
found that he talked much more freely than usual.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he insisted, his dull eyes glowing with
hate, "Alexander Poubalov is in Boston. I am not one to
be mistaken in that man, and his presence here means
trouble for any, perhaps all of us."</p>

<p>"What could he wish to do against poor Russians, Nicholas
Litizki, who have no intention of revisiting their native
country?" asked one of the group.</p>

<p>"Better ask what has he done?" retorted the tailor.
"Here is Ivan Strobel, more prosperous than we, with
more powerful friends, and what has Poubalov done to
him? Would that I knew!"</p>

<p>"As soon as Poubalov appears," remarked another,
"Litizki will lay the very next crime that occurs to his
hands."</p>

<p>"Where Poubalov goes," said Litizki, "you will ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
find treachery and oppression. It is not for you, Peter, to
make light of Poubalov. You have felt his hand as well
as I."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Peter, "but in the Strobel matter you
do not forget what the police have discovered, do you?
Well might you suspect the dirty spy, were it not that one
does not go far, it seems, to find the woman in the case."</p>

<p>"Bah!" sneered Litizki; "do you forget that there are two
women in the case? And have you seen either of them?
No. Well, I have seen both. I have no unkind word for
Lizzie White, with whom they say he went away; but I
tell you, friends, Ivan Strobel could not have preferred
her to Miss Hilman." He pronounced the name softly as
if it aroused a feeling akin to reverence. "You should see
her," he continued; "she is a very angel of beauty and
goodness. Happy would be the man whose privilege it
was simply to worship her; and as for him whom she
would permit to love her&mdash;Bah! talk to me not about the
woman in the case until you have seen Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>His friends listened gravely. They found nothing ludicrous
in Litizki's occasionally extravagant language. When
he was stirred to something like eloquence, it was almost
always by a memory of the wrongs he had suffered, and
then no language could have been too imaginative to express
the bitterness with which his sympathetic hearers
listened.</p>

<p>"Where did you see her, Litizki?" asked one of them.</p>

<p>"Never mind now," he replied; "I have seen her since
Strobel disappeared. She is bearing up bravely, and scorns
the suggestion that he eloped with Miss White. She is
devoting her life to finding him, and it is my opinion that
every poor Russian in Boston ought to do the same."</p>

<p>He looked furtively from face to face in the group, to
observe the effect of his words. Most of them stared at the
floor.</p>

<p>"Strobel was a good man," said one, after a long pause;
"but what could any of us do?"</p>

<p>"Do?" repeated the tailor, and his indignant reply died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
on his lips as he remembered with sudden distinctness the
fiasco of the previous night. "We could at least watch
Poubalov, and I, for one, intend to do so. I cannot sit, and
cut, and sew, and think, while he is in this country and
my friend is in his power."</p>

<p>"Nicholas Litizki," said one who had not spoken previously,
"if I were in your place, I would let the Strobel
case take care of itself."</p>

<p>The tailor glanced at the speaker.</p>

<p>"You speak as if we were still in Russia," he said,
"and you had authority to command me."</p>

<p>"You will do as you please," returned the other; "but
if I were in your place, I should keep quiet."</p>

<p>"Listen then, all of you," exclaimed Litizki, with energy;
"I shall not keep quiet. I shall pursue Poubalov, I
shall do everything possible to effect the rescue of Ivan
Strobel, and if I have to sacrifice my business and everything,
and every chance I have in the world, I shall do
it."</p>

<p>The door of the little workshop opened, and Alexander
Poubalov stepped in.</p>

<p>"Good-day, to you, Nicholas Litizki, and friends," he
said with easy familiarity. "When one is in a foreign
land, and has need of something, he will naturally apply
to a fellow-countryman, will he not?"</p>

<p>He looked around at the group, as if expecting a general
assent. The men looked darkly at him and were silent. If
all had not seen him in Russia, they knew who he was;
and if there had been any doubt, they would have but
needed to glance at Litizki to see that he was facing his
arch-enemy.</p>

<p>The tailor rose from his bench, and his sallow face was
deathly pale.</p>

<p>"Alexander Poubalov," he said determinedly, "this is
no place for you. You hear no words of welcome&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gently, Litizki, my friend, gently," interposed the
spy; "I call simply on business. I want clothes. Will you
make them for me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not for all the wealth of the czar!" returned the tailor,
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Then we will waste no time discussing material and
prices. Good-day again," and Poubalov walked grandly
out.</p>

<p>The group exchanged inquiring glances in silence for a
moment, and then Litizki exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You see, friends! you see! I was not mistaken in the
man, and he is the same here as in Russia&mdash;the spy who
goes everywhere and does nothing. I don't need to tell
you that he wanted no garments. He came here for a purpose,
and he accomplished it. It is now my turn, Vargovitch,
to utter a warning. Poubalov's eyes are upon you,
and if I were you&mdash;Bah!"</p>

<p>Litizki had begun to imitate the serious tone in which
his friend had warned him to let the Strobel case alone,
but it seemed superfluous to suggest a warning to Vargovitch
after he had himself seen the spy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," said Vargovitch, "and I simply
repeat that you'd better keep out of the Strobel case."</p>

<p>"Vargovitch," cried Litizki, "you do not talk like a
loyal Russian. Is it you who would stand by and let this
spy work his will among us?"</p>

<p>"I have no more love for Poubalov and his work than
you have, Litizki," replied Vargovitch. "May there not be
reasons for my counsel&mdash;reasons that you do not understand?"</p>

<p>Litizki peered at the speaker silently and resumed his
work. Vargovitch left the room and shortly afterward
the other visitors dispersed.</p>

<p>"I would do what Vargovitch says, Nicholas Litizki,"
remarked one of the tailor's assistants.</p>

<p>Litizki worked away as if he had not heard, and his
thoughts were not pleasant or hopeful. It had seemed to
him as if every compatriot of his in the city would need
but the suggestion to unite in an effort to outwit Poubalov
and rescue Strobel. Litizki could not understand it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and he was disappointed. It was while he was meditating
thus that Clara and Louise called.</p>

<p>The little tailor almost blushed as he left his bench and
went to meet them.</p>

<p>"I should almost say," he began hurriedly, after he
had awkwardly acknowledged their greetings, "that you
ought not to come here. Are you aware that Poubalov
may be, probably is, watching your every step? That
man has the eyes of a thousand, and if it were possible to
throw him off the track it would be best to do so. But
it is impossible. If you did not come here, he would find
out that you know me, and he would infer the rest."</p>

<p>"You seem troubled, Mr. Litizki," said Clara, kindly;
"have you, too, given up Mr. Strobel?"</p>

<p>"I? Never! It is because I do not give him up that&mdash;well,
yes, I am troubled. Why disguise the fact that Poubalov
is a powerful enemy? I am not a coward, Miss Hilman;
my life is not worth enough to me to make me
care for it, but I fear that man's power will be too great
for the friends of Ivan Strobel."</p>

<p>"You have seen him, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I&mdash;" Litizki averted his eyes and continued: "He
has been here, to-day, not more than half an hour ago."</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Litizki," said Clara, "that you will not put
yourself in his power. If you feel that it is dangerous to
help in the search for Mr. Strobel, you must not do it."</p>

<p>"Dangerous? It is too late to think of that, if I cared
about it. That man has possession of Mr. Strobel, and will
keep him until he has accomplished some purpose. Strobel
will not yield." Litizki paused and looked gloomily
away. "You see, it is a question of how to circumvent
Poubalov," he added.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Mr. Litizki, that your loyalty to your
friend will bring misfortune upon you. I should be very
sorry for that."</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Hilman," muttered the tailor, and a sad
wistfulness lingered briefly in his eyes, "you are worthy
of my benefactor. I could not say more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Clara was deeply touched, and her voice trembled as
she said:</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Litizki. I hope to be worthy of your
kind thoughts. I may learn something to-night that will
put another light on the case. Is it too much to ask you
to call at my uncle's house some time during the evening?"</p>

<p>"Not if you lived in Siberia, Miss Hilman. Where is it,
and when shall I come?"</p>

<p>Clara gave him the address and left him, begging him
to come early. When they were on the way home, Louise
said:</p>

<p>"I am more and more amazed at your method every
day, dear. Have I not been good to listen, and ask no
questions and volunteer no advice?"</p>

<p>"Too good, dear. I should often want advice, and ask it,
but that I fear hurting you by not following it. I must go
my own way."</p>

<p>"Of course you must, but I was just leading up to this
question: What in the world do you want of Mr. Litizki
this evening?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know myself, dear; but if that 'second
driver' calls, I hope to make Mr. Litizki useful. Will that
do?"</p>

<p>It had to, for Clara fell to thinking, and her cousin saw
that questions would be irritating.</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke sent word from his office that he should
not come to dinner, and he had not arrived when the servant
announced a caller, and handed a card to Clara. It
was Poubalov.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Clara, showing not the least surprise,
"that I'd better see him alone. Will you wait here" (they
were in the dining-room), "in case I should want you?"</p>

<p>Poubalov smiled and his face looked almost attractive
as he rose and bowed when Clara entered the drawing-room.
At that instant Clara felt that but for his self-confessed
methods of deceit, she could have trusted him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
this in spite of the black pictures that Litizki and Paul
Palovna had drawn of him.</p>

<p>"I am delighted, Miss Hilman," he said, "to observe
that you endure your sorrow and your remarkable work
so well."</p>

<p>"I am told that nothing escapes you," replied Clara,
"and so I suppose you know all about my search for the
driver of Mr. Strobel's second carriage."</p>

<p>"Miss Clara," said a servant at the hall door, "a man
who says his name is Billings wishes to see you."</p>

<p>"Show him into the library, please," answered Clara,
then to Poubalov&mdash;"Will you pardon me? This is the
man of whom I was speaking, and I must see him."</p>

<p>"Pray do," responded the Russian; "my message can
well wait until he has gone."</p>

<p>Clara at once crossed the hall into the library. The minute
she was out of the room Poubalov went to the door
and cautiously opened it a little way. He closed it quickly
and reflected. Clara had left the door from the hall to the
library wide open, and the street door would be easily
in view to anybody in the library.</p>

<p>Poubalov went from one to another of the several windows
and looked out. From one at the side of the room he
saw a few yards of turf bounded by a low hedge, and beyond
that the park-like grounds surrounding a large
dwelling. This window was partially open.</p>

<p>The spy looked once more toward the hall door. He had
given his hat and stick to the servant, and they had been
placed somewhere in the hall. He shrugged his shoulders,
pushed the window further up and stepped out.</p>

<p>A moment later, Louise, who was idly gazing out of the
dining-room window, was considerably startled to see a
man, whom in the gathering dusk she could not recognize,
leap over the hedge into the adjoining grounds, and
disappear behind the shrubbery.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">LITIZKI BREAKS HIS APPOINTMENT.</p>


<p>In the brief interval that elapsed between the time
when she turned from Poubalov and the moment she entered
the library, Clara reflected that while her loyal
heart would rebel at the story to be told by Billings, she
must hear him patiently, and not permit her distrust of
him to manifest itself. One can think to good purpose in
even so short a time as it takes to walk across a room.
Clara was fully resolved to be guided by her reason alone
in dealing with Billings, and not to permit herself to
doubt his story if it should prove, as was probable, that
what he had to say tended to corroborate the detective's
theory.</p>

<p>Yet, when she looked at him, all her woman's intuition
rebelled. She saw a man perhaps twenty-five years old,
with nothing whatever remarkable in his appearance; but
in his eyes and attitude there seemed to be a consciousness
of antagonism, as if he expected to be doubted,
sharply cross-examined, and as if he were determined
that nothing should shake his story. His sullen, dogged
expression was a help to Clara in conquering her immediate
aversion to him, and she began the critical interview
with a move that surprised and embarrassed him.</p>

<p>He was sitting, holding his hat on his knees, at the
farther side of the room. Clara crossed directly to him
with outstretched hand, saying:</p>

<p>"I am Miss Hilman. You are Mr. Billings, I believe. I
cannot tell you how glad I am to see you. Mr. Bowker
may have told you how I hunted the city over to find you.
Sit down, please; let me take your hat."</p>

<p>Billings had risen awkwardly as he saw that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
coming toward him, and, quite unaware of how she managed
it, he found that she had taken one of his hands in
her own. In his confusion he let his hat fall, picked it up
hastily, and at last sat down again, feeling still the warm
clasp of Clara's hand, while with bewildered eyes he saw
this self-possessed, queenly young woman place his battered
hat upon a table and draw up a chair opposite to
him. He had not said a word. If he had come with any
set phrases for beginning his story, they were completely
driven from his mind.</p>

<p>Clara looked at him for a moment, and he averted his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Were you acquainted with Mr. Strobel?" she asked
presently, speaking in low tones that needed no art to
color with the sadness that weighed upon her heart.</p>

<p>"No'm, I wasn't," replied Billings, with a quick glance
at her.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that," said Clara, "and yet it shows
how kind you are to come here and tell me about this matter.
I suppose you had to come a long way."</p>

<p>"I live in the North End," said Billings, uneasily.
"Bowker told me to come."</p>

<p>"The North End is a long way off," she declared, "and
I thank you just the same. I suppose you may have told
Mr. Bowker so carefully about this that you are tired of
the matter, but I should like very much to hear you myself.
Do you mind telling me just what you told him?"</p>

<p>"That's what I come for," and Billings seemed to be
considerably relieved. "I was driving down Park Street,"
he began, "when I saw that the coupé just in front of me
had got into trouble. I went slow because people got
around thick, and, besides, I wanted to see what was the
matter. As I was looking, the man in the coupé clumb
out and asked me was I engaged. I told him no, and he
got in. He seemed to be in a hurry."</p>

<p>"One moment," interposed Clara, gently. The narration
struck her as distinctly parrot-like, and if it were something
that he had learned to recite, she preferred to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the thread of his story before he had come to the important
part, rather than give him the advantage of establishing
a statement in smooth order. If he were telling the
truth, no manner of interruption could prevent him from
eventually making himself understood; if he were lying,
she must involve him in contradictions. So, without premeditation,
Clara said:</p>

<p>"You are going just a little too fast for me, and I hope
you will forgive me. Every detail, you know, seems important
to me. Where had you been that morning, Mr.
Billings?"</p>

<p>"Been to a funeral, miss," he answered promptly.</p>

<p>"Yes, so I understood; but where?"</p>

<p>"Out to Mount Auburn."</p>

<p>"That is quite a long way from Park Street, isn't it? It
must be four miles."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, 'bout that."</p>

<p>"It was about eleven o'clock, or a little after, when Mr.
Strobel's coupé broke down, and you had been to Mount
Auburn and had just got back. I see. Where did you leave
your passengers, the persons you took to the funeral, I
mean?"</p>

<p>With a glance of sullen resentment Billings answered:</p>

<p>"At their house."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Billings," and Clara smiled as if she were not
in the least annoyed, "but that isn't telling where. I
didn't ask for the street and number. Why should I? It
was in Cambridge, was it not?"</p>

<p>After the slightest perceptible hesitation, Billings answered:</p>

<p>"No; 'twas in the West End."</p>

<p>"Ah, then you had come over Beacon Hill on your
way somewhere. Where were you going, Mr. Billings?"</p>

<p>As Billings hesitated more noticeably, she continued:</p>

<p>"Do you have some regular place where you wait for
passengers, or do you drive about picking them up where
you find them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was going to the Old Colony Depot," said Billings,
huskily.</p>

<p>"I see. Is it customary, Mr. Billings, for cabmen to leave
the curtains of their carriages closely drawn after they
leave a funeral party?"</p>

<p>"No, 'tain't, not long, but you wouldn't have me stop in
front of the house to pull 'em up, would you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. You did quite right, doubtless. When
did you first see the coupé?"</p>

<p>"At the corner of Beacon. It turned into Park Street
just ahead of me."</p>

<p>"Where did Mr. Strobel tell you to take him?"</p>

<p>"To Dr. Merrill's church, Parker Avenue, Roxbury."</p>

<p>Billings didn't know it, but his examiner came very
near to breaking down at this point. There was nothing
as yet to show that the driver was not telling the truth,
although Clara had prepared a trap for him that she intended
to spring a little later, and the mention of the
church where she was to be married brought up such a
flood of emotions that it seemed as if she would choke.
Then, too, whether Billings were practicing deceit or not,
it was certain that for this moment at least she was following
her lover's journey correctly, and she had arrived
at that critical point where the change in his intentions,
or in his power to act, occurred. So, it was in a very
faint voice that she told Billings to go on. He immediately
resumed his parrot-like narration:</p>

<p>"He seemed to be in a hurry, for he spoke quick. I
closed the door on him, and got into my seat as fast as I
could and whipped up. I wanted to get along myself, you
see, 'cause it was quite a long drive, and I had to get back
to the depot."</p>

<p>This last sentence sounded like a fresh thought interjected
on the spur of the moment, for Billings spoke it
slower than the rest, and glanced inquiringly at Clara, as
if to see how she took it. She noticed the difference, but
simply nodded, and Billings went on.</p>

<p>"Nothing happened till we got to Elliot Street. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the gentleman opened the door and hollered 'Driver!' I
pulled up a bit and turned round to see what he wanted.
'Driver!' says he, 'I've changed my mind. Take me to
the Park Square Station.' 'All right, sir,' says I, and he
closed the door again. So I druv 'im to the station, and he
got out and give me a dollar and went inside, and that's
all there is to it."</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Billings," said
Clara; "I suppose you went directly to the Old Colony
Depot after that?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. That's where I went."</p>

<p>He rose as if there could be nothing more for him to say,
but Clara was not done with him.</p>

<p>"Just one more question," she said; "sit down again,
please. Did you see Mr. Strobel speak or bow to anybody
at the station?"</p>

<p>"No'm. There wasn't many people about, and he hurried
inside like as if his train was just going."</p>

<p>"Was there anybody there whom you knew?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm, and you can ask him. A feller named O'Brien,
who works there, was just at the door as we drew up,
and he says 'Hello' to me. He'll tell you he saw me land
my passenger there, for he came forward, thinking to
get the gentleman's bag to carry."</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Brien may have noticed where Mr. Strobel went
after going into the station," mused Clara.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, he might. You might ask him."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I presume I shall. Now, Mr. Billings, I
want to show you in some way that I appreciate your
kindness in coming here to tell me this. I have had to
drive about a great deal for two days, and shall have to
use a carriage to-morrow. I shall be glad to employ you."</p>

<p>Billings flushed and shifted about uneasily.</p>

<p>"I can't, miss," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Why not, Mr. Billings?"</p>

<p>The driver stole a glance at her earnest face, and saw
nothing there but sad surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" Clara gave the man no help by suggesting
a possible excuse.</p>

<p>"My carriage is engaged&mdash;that is," he blurted, "I
haven't got any carriage that would be fit for you."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with the one in which you took Mr.
Strobel?"</p>

<p>"It got smashed up and is being repaired. You see," and
he mumbled his words so that they were almost unintelligible,
"the same day a party of toughs hired it; they
were kind o' swell toughs, and they got on a racket, and
the carriage was damaged. 'Tain't fit to use."</p>

<p>"Mr. Billings!" Clara spoke with a sudden energy that
startled the driver, "was Mr. Strobel in the carriage when
it was damaged?"</p>

<p>"No'm, no'm, he wan't," stammered Billings.</p>

<p>The explanation suggested an entirely new thought to
Clara. Before her mental vision there came swiftly a picture
of her lover struggling with somebody&mdash;might it not
be Poubalov?&mdash;in the carriage itself. She seemed to see a
violent conflict in which seats and fixtures gave way as
men's bodies fell heavily. And Ivan was overpowered, his
enemies triumphed, he was motionless, unconscious&mdash;perhaps
fatally injured, and they had hidden him away
somewhere lest their crime come to the light!</p>

<p>This was wholly unlike the vision she had seen on the
evening of what should have been her wedding day; it
had none of the aspects of an hallucination; for as the
alarming details shaped themselves in her thoughts, she
was conscious that Billings sat before her, looking frightened,
and that he rose again to go. In this instance she
was but following the suggestions brought out by her inquiry
to what might be their logical, natural conclusion.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you cannot drive me to-morrow," she said,
recovering and withdrawing her eyes, which had been
fixed in a strained stare upon Billings for a very brief period.
"Before you go, tell me the names and addresses of
the persons you took to the funeral, please."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't remember," replied Billings, uneasily. "I shall
have to look up my book; 'tain't here."</p>

<p>"Will you do so?" asked Clara, pleasantly, convinced
now that the man was lying; "and send the names to me,
please. Will you do that to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," replied Billings reaching for his hat.</p>

<p>"And what is your address?"</p>

<p>Billings told her, and she laid her hand gently on his
arm. An idea that had occurred to her vaguely when his
name was announced as she stood before Poubalov, now
recurred to her in the shape of a plan. She would have
Billings confront the Russian, and watch their faces narrowly
for some sign of recognition, or alarm.</p>

<p>"Will you come into the next room a moment?" she said,
"I have something to show you."</p>

<p>There seemed to be a shade of suspicion in his eyes, but
he made no objection, and Clara conducted him to the
drawing-room. It was dark. With a premonition of disappointment,
Clara found a match on the mantel and lit the
gas. After a hasty glance around she opened the door to
the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Lou!" she whispered eagerly, "have you seen Mr.
Poubalov?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Louise, coming forward and entering the
parlor; "has he gone? Then it must have been he!"</p>

<p>"Who? What have you seen? Wait, come into the hall.
Will you sit down just a minute longer, Mr. Billings? I
shall be but a moment."</p>

<p>Billings complied, and the young ladies passed quickly
into the hall, where the first thing that Clara saw were
Poubalov's hat and stick lying upon a table. She turned in
the utmost wonderment upon her cousin.</p>

<p>"All I can say," said Louise, "is that I saw a man
leap over the hedge into Mr. Jordan's grounds a short
time after you went into the drawing-room to meet
Poubalov. I couldn't tell who it was, couldn't even see
that he had no hat on. I feared he might be a tramp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
but thought then that he had been frightened away, and
that there was no danger."</p>

<p>"He was frightened away?" murmured Clara, feeling
her blood run cold; "he dared not face his man Billings!"</p>

<p>"I supposed," continued Louise, in agitation, "that Poubalov
was with you. I heard no voices, but thought perhaps
that you had gone into the library with him, for a
door closed once."</p>

<p>"Yes, when Billings came. Oh! if Litizki were only
here!"</p>

<p>"Why! what could he do?"</p>

<p>"I would have him follow Billings. Oh, I could cry! it
is the one opportunity for solving this mystery that we
have found, and now we are going to lose it!"</p>

<p>Louise was greatly distressed.</p>

<p>"Isn't there some way that you can detain Billings," she
suggested, "until Litizki arrives?"</p>

<p>"No. He's been trying to get away for several minutes.
It is just possible that Litizki may be near. I'll go out
with Billings, as if to call at a neighbor's, and if I see Litizki
will put him on the track at once."</p>

<p>She went upstairs for her hat, lingering over the preparation
in order to give Litizki all possible opportunity to
keep his appointment, and when she came down again Billings
was in the hall.</p>

<p>"I can't wait no longer," he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Clara; "I thank you again for calling.
I am going as far as the next house, and you can escort
me."</p>

<p>Billings scowled with disagreeable surprise. At the gate
he waited to see which way she would turn.</p>

<p>"I'm not going that way, miss," he said, and started off
at a rapid pace in the opposite direction.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">WHAT BECAME OF LITIZKI.</p>


<p>Clara retired before her uncle returned, and when at
last he appeared, it was only to pack his bag and hurry
away to catch the midnight train for New York.</p>

<p>"I may be gone a week," he told Louise, "and I may
get back in two days. Telegraph me at the Travelers' Hotel,
if I am wanted for anything."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke's departure was a great disappointment
to Clara. She reproached herself that she had not made an
opportunity to tell him about her conversation with Poubalov
and Litizki; it was his right to know everything
that could possibly bear upon the case, and could she have
told him, she would have besought him to advise her.</p>

<p>She was now in a bewildering maze of doubts and uncertainties.
Billings had lied to her; she was almost as sure
of that as if she had already proved it; but at what part
of his story the falsehood began she could only guess.
There was no doubt that Ivan had taken Billings' carriage.
Did he give the driver orders to go to the Park Square
Station? Did Billings drive to the station? The latter
question she could answer with some degree of satisfaction
by inquiry of the man O'Brien, and that seemed the
first thing to do; but what then?</p>

<p>Poubalov had called to say something, and had not only
gone away without saying it, but had gone in such wise
as to leave no reasonable doubt that he dared not face the
driver of the closed carriage. Was it not an inevitable inference
that Billings had been hired by the Russian? It
was with evident difficulty that Billings had stumbled
through the story as it was. Would not Poubalov, recognizing
the driver's mental inferiority, have argued that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
they were suddenly brought face to face, Billings would
have betrayed their complicity by at least a start?</p>

<p>And Litizki, what had become of him? It was not to be
thought of that he had abandoned the case. Poubalov had
called at his shop during the day, unquestionably with
some ulterior design. Could anything be more reasonable
than to suppose that in some way the spy had frustrated
the attempt of Litizki to help her?</p>

<p>The more she pondered the various puzzling aspects of
the case, the more everything seemed to center upon Poubalov,
and she shuddered with apprehension as Litizki's
characterization of him recurred to her. He was, indeed, a
terrible enemy.</p>

<p>Having in mind only the known facts in the case, and
disregarding utterly all inferences and conjectures, she
tried to reason along various lines, in the hope that thus
a theory might be set up which should command sufficient
respect to justify a new departure in her search. She began
with the fact that Ivan had made every preparation
for marriage&mdash;and there a new thought presented itself.
He had surrendered his room; he must, therefore, have
packed his belongings; had they been disturbed? This
might be a matter of infinite significance, and one that she
would attend to without delay.</p>

<p>"Louise," she said (they were at the breakfast table and
her cousin was lingering over her coffee while Clara was
absorbed in thought), "will you go downtown with me
again to-day?"</p>

<p>"Of course, dear," replied Louise; "I will be ready in
ten minutes."</p>

<p>Louise was relieved at Clara's suggestions. She had
been hopelessly wondering what Clara could find to do
next, and she dreaded for her cousin's health should there
prove to be no active work upon which she could concentrate
her faculties. She left the room to prepare for the
day's jaunt, and Clara resumed her thinking.</p>

<p>Every preparation for marriage, and a start actually
made for the church. Then an accident that somebody had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
prepared. Who? There must have been somebody who
had a great object to attain in preventing the marriage, or
in getting possession of Ivan. Suppose it were Poubalov,
what then? With the insight he himself had given her
into his character, would he not do everything possible to
throw her off the right track? If he had abducted Ivan,
would he hesitate to abduct Litizki if he found that the little
tailor was in his way?</p>

<p>It was vain to speculate for a reason for Poubalov's
main action; that must lie in his capacity as a paid spy
of a government with which Ivan, apparently, had been at
one time in conflict. His subsequent actions, so far as
she knew them, were all explainable on the theory that he
had had to do with Ivan's disappearance.</p>

<p>And so her thoughts revolved around Poubalov, finding
at every turn a trace of obliquity that was wholly in consonance
with his character and his confessed methods.</p>

<p>Clara felt that her reasoning was bringing her to no definite
end, although her brain teemed with courses of action
that might have been possible could she have commanded
the services of a corps of shrewd, faithful detectives.
It is generally so with persons who have a great
task to accomplish; they find themselves with more plans
than resources, more brains than hands. Clara had just
come to the sensible conclusion that, compelled to work
substantially alone, she would undertake exactly one
thing at a time, and, having chosen a line of inquiry,
would follow it uninterruptedly to the end, when a servant
announced that a man had called to see her.</p>

<p>"I couldn't catch his name, Miss Clara," said the servant,
"but I'm afraid he's a beggar, he looks so forlorn
and seedy."</p>

<p>Clara knew who it was and she sprang from her chair
with more eagerness and animation than she had manifested
at any time since the disastrous wedding day. She
fairly ran into the drawing-room, both her hands extended,
her face radiant with smiles, and completely overwhelmed
poor Litizki with the warmth of her greeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was so afraid something dreadful had happened to
you!" she exclaimed, "but I knew that you had not deserted
me."</p>

<p>"Deserted you?" said Litizki huskily; "no, but I was
afraid you would think so. I didn't know what Poubalov
might have told you, and unless you thoroughly understand
that man, that fiend, Miss Hilman, he is likely to
make you believe anything."</p>

<p>"Then you know that he had been here! You must have
recognized his hat in the hall."</p>

<p>"I saw it there and his stick, too, but I knew before
then that he had been here. I came to tell you."</p>

<p>Litizki paused, the look of grateful relief that had overspread
his features at first giving way to his customary
depressed expression, and he fell into his habit of speaking
with averted eyes, or with but occasional furtive
glances at the person addressed.</p>

<p>"Do tell me," said Clara; "I have been very anxious
about you."</p>

<p>Litizki thought a moment, and then asked:</p>

<p>"May I see Poubalov's cane?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied Clara, and she brought it to him
from the hall.</p>

<p>Litizki took it, looked it over, felt along the top, and
suddenly drew forth the handle, from which a gleaming
blade depended. Clara started back with a low exclamation
of alarm. Litizki touched the edge of the blade with
his thumb, as a man tests a razor.</p>

<p>"Alexander Poubalov," he murmured gloomily, "held
this over my heart once, not so long ago."</p>

<p>He thrust it back into its sheath, where it came to rest
with an angry click, and handed the cane to Clara.</p>

<p>"That is the kind of man he is, Miss Hilman," he said;
"I thought you might like to know."</p>

<p>If he had wished to impress Clara with the horrible
gravity of the situation, with its frightful possibilities,
he succeeded beyond measure. She held the cane, feeling
that it epitomized the spy's career, and a dreadful faintness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
depressed her which she at length overcame with
the utmost difficulty. Having returned the concealed
weapon to the hall, she sank into a chair and asked Litizki
to tell her what had happened to him during the previous
evening.</p>

<p>"You asked me to call early," he began, "and I set
out to do so. Without going into unnecessary detail, I will
say that I came up the street that ends nearly in front of
this house, a little after seven o'clock. The exact time
doesn't matter, for you will know as nearly as you need
to when I tell you that just as I was about to cross the
road I saw Poubalov in front of me. He had come by another
route. I wasn't surprised, for the man seems to
read one's thoughts, and it was as if he had known that I
was coming, and had determined to prevent me.</p>

<p>"I doubted whether it would be wise to call as long as
he was in the neighborhood, but all doubts were set at
rest when he himself went up the steps and rang. Of
course it would have been the height of folly for me to
enter the house then."</p>

<p>"You had the right to," interrupted Clara; "I had
asked you to come, and I needed you very much."</p>

<p>Litizki looked so miserable that Clara hastened to add:</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to reprove or find fault, Mr. Litizki. I
forgot for the moment everything except that eventually,
after Poubalov had run away, I wished you were at
hand!"</p>

<p>"I hope I made no mistake, Miss Hilman," said Litizki;
"at all events I could see no other course at the time than
to do what I did."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you were right. Go on, please."</p>

<p>"I determined to wait until Poubalov went away. If I
had been familiar with the house, I might have found
my way to the back door and sent word to you by a servant,
but I dared not venture, for I knew not from what
window Poubalov might be looking. The same reason induced
me to leave the street, which is clearly in view from
some windows, and, moreover, I did not care to risk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
questions from anybody as to why I was loitering about.
So I slipped into the adjoining grounds, where there is a
lot of shrubbery, and crawled under a tree whose
branches hung low.</p>

<p>"From where I lay I could see whether anybody entered
or left the house by the front door and I also saw
all the windows on one side. I had been there less than
a minute when somebody went up the steps and was admitted.
I could not see who it was, for the evening was
cloudy and it grew dark very quickly."</p>

<p>"It was a man named Billings," said Clara; "he drove
the closed carriage which took Mr. Strobel from Park
Street."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I wish I had known it. Well, events happened
pretty quickly just then, for it seemed to me that
less than another minute had passed when Poubalov appeared
at one of the windows on the side of the house.
He raised it, stepped out, and leaped over the hedge, not
five yards from where I lay. He passed so close to me that
I could have reached out from under the tree and tripped
him up! I lay very still, wondering what his action could
mean, for as you must know, he was bareheaded. If I had
dreamed then of going to the house, I could not have done
so, for he crouched down by the hedge near the street,
and I could see that he had his eyes on the door and that
he was waiting. I then determined to follow him wherever
he should go, for of course he meditated villainy. I may
have prevented him in that&mdash;&mdash; Oh! I don't know!"</p>

<p>Litizki fairly groaned these words, and Clara was about
to utter an anxious inquiry, when he resumed:</p>

<p>"Don't let me disturb you, Miss Hilman; I will tell the
whole wretched story. How long we lay there I don't
know, but you must, for at last you, I think it was you,
came out of the house and walked down to the gate to
say good-night to somebody who left you there&mdash;Billings I
suppose&mdash;and walked away in a direction opposite to us.
You, was it you? Yes, you waited a moment, and returned
to the house, whereupon Poubalov immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
got up, leaped over the hedge, darted across the road as
noiselessly as if he were a cat, and disappeared.</p>

<p>"I followed as well as I could, and, as luck would have
it, I soon overtook him, for he was strolling along slowly,
as unconcerned as if he owned a house near by and were
out for a breath of fresh air. He rambled on until he came
to Washington Street, when he stopped at the curb and
looked idly about for several seconds. There were many
people about, and his bareheaded condition attracted attention.
All the shops were open, and suddenly he
darted into one of them. It was not a hat store, but when
he came out, which was almost immediately, he had a hat
on. I suppose he bought it for an extravagant sum off the
head of some stranger. It would be like him.</p>

<p>"He idled about the neighborhood for as much as an
hour, Miss Hilman, and I did all that I could think of to
keep him in view without exposing myself. The man is a
fiend with a million eyes! But wait, I'll tell you. At last
he moved along, and, of course, I followed faithfully, noting
every turn, that I might be able to go again by the same
way if possible, or at least to the same place, wherever
that might be. For in spite of my care I don't know what
was his destination, if he had any. It is for this reason
that I say I may have prevented him from some fresh
villainy.</p>

<p>"At last, in a street to which I could readily return, he
paused. I was across the way from him, and I slipped into
a doorway, where I was wholly in the dark. I could see
him, though, and for a long, long time he paced slowly
back and forth, never once speaking to anybody, or looking
about, or getting out of my sight. It didn't matter to
me. I would have stayed on till I starved in my tracks,
but eventually he crossed the street directly toward me.
He could not see me, of that I am certain, but of course
he had seen me&mdash;and&mdash;I am a helpless, good-for-nothing
fool, Miss Hilman!"</p>

<p>"Why say that?" asked Clara kindly.</p>

<p>"Because he came straight into the doorway, put his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
hand lightly on my shoulder and said in that deep, scornful
voice of his: 'It is enough, Nicholas Litizki. Let us
now go home,' and he laughed disagreeably."</p>

<p>Litizki stared aside with an expression of utter self-contempt.</p>

<p>"I weakly said to myself that it was a ruse to get rid of
me, and I followed again as he walked briskly away. He
took a street car and went straight to his room in Bulfinch
Place. It was past midnight, and so I came this

<p class="center">A NEW DEPARTURE.</p>


<p>"What a hard and disagreeable experience," exclaimed
Clara, "and so strange too! You have no occasion to reproach
yourself, Mr. Litizki, with any neglect. You did
all that any man could do, I am sure, and it may not
prove to be unfortunate that Poubalov saw that you
were watching him."</p>

<p>"I wish I could think so," responded the tailor, "and
it is wonderfully kind of you to be so patient with my
failure. Isn't there something that I can do now? I can do
no work until this matter is settled, and it is torture to
remain idle."</p>

<p>"I know how true that is," sighed Clara; "yes, there is
something I think you can do. If Poubalov had not called
last evening, and so changed all our plans, I should have
asked you to follow Billings when he left the house. I
have little faith in him, Mr. Litizki, and it seems to me
that on leaving here last night he must have gone directly
to report to his accomplice, or employer. Are you sure
that Poubalov spoke to nobody?"</p>

<p>"If he did, it was no more than a passing word. He
seemed to know no one."</p>

<p>Clara had to stop and think, for Litizki's story tended
to upset her theories concerning Poubalov's exit and his
relations with Billings. Could it be possible, after all, that
Billings had not been employed by the spy, and that the
latter, therefore, had had nothing to do with Ivan's disappearance?
Perhaps Poubalov worked through still another
accomplice, and, suspecting possible treachery, had
been at the pains of secretly following Billings, to learn
whether he and the unknown other were faithful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>This seemed rather a wild supposition, for it would not
be like Poubalov to admit others into his secret operations.</p>

<p>Had he followed Billings? There was no doubt in
Clara's mind that this was what he started to do when he
leaped over the hedge and ran to the side of the road opposite
to where Billings was walking. Had Poubalov lost
Billings in the darkness, and, observing Litizki's pursuit,
purposely dodged hither and thither, to discomfit the
tailor?</p>

<p>From every question Clara turned more puzzled than
before. It must be that she was on the wrong track, else
a reasonable answer could be found, a reasonable explanation
suggested for every act. Perhaps she was wrong in
obstinately connecting Poubalov with the first act in the
tragedy, the disappearance of Ivan; but if so, could his
conduct even then be explained?</p>

<p>"Mr. Litizki," said Clara, at length, "I want to know
all that can possibly be learned about this man Billings.
He gave me his address. Will you undertake to look him
up? Unless he is very closely in league with Poubalov, he
will not know who you are, and for that matter it probably
won't be necessary for you to meet him. Eventually
you might have to follow him somewhere, but at the start
you might learn a great deal from his neighbors."</p>

<p>"I'll do it, Miss Hilman; but I promise you now that
every step I take will be dogged by Poubalov."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind. You will be on your guard against
him&mdash;and yet, I do not want you to expose yourself to
danger," and Clara shuddered as she thought of the long
dagger concealed in Poubalov's cane.</p>

<p>"Bah!" returned Litizki, "I care nothing for the danger.
My only fear is that the villain will overreach me
in anything I may attempt. I am no match for him in skill
and cunning, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>Litizki was woefully dejected. Never did man so long
to be possessed of genius, or even talent, and the tailor
was painfully aware of his own deficiencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"You underestimate yourself," said Clara; "you see
that I have confidence in you, else I would not ask you to
undertake the investigation. Will you begin at once?"</p>

<p>"Gladly. You cannot imagine how much courage your
good words give me. If I dared to cherish a hope of any
kind, it would be that I should accomplish something
that would justify your good opinion."</p>

<p>"You have already done so, and will do more, have no
doubt of it! I am going downtown myself. Suppose you go
to the address Billings gave me, make such inquiries
there as seem advisable, and, if you see nothing to command
your immediate attention, come and tell me what
you have found. I shall be at Mrs. White's. If you come
after I go, you will find some word from me as to where
to go next."</p>

<p>She gave him Billings' address, saw him to the door
with a cheering smile, and then turned to Louise, who
had been ready to start for several minutes.</p>

<p>"He had what was to him a dismal story to tell," said
Clara, "and I knew he would rather tell it to me alone."</p>

<p>"I supposed so," returned Louise, "and so I took pains
not to interrupt you. I wish I could think a quarter as
well as you do, dear. I don't feel as if I were the least
use."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Lou," and Clara embraced her cousin
affectionately; "if I could think as well as you imagine I
do, we should be out of the difficulty in a day. What do
you suppose I should do without you?"</p>

<p>Louise was profoundly convinced that Clara would do
exactly as she had been doing all along, but she didn't say
so. She would have sympathized acutely with Litizki's
self-abasement had she known how earnestly he had
striven to be of use, and how utterly he had seemed to
fail.</p>

<p>They went first to the Park Square Station, Clara, as
usual, deeply absorbed in studying the strange problems
that confronted her. The impression she had received
this morning that Poubalov might not have been associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
directly with Ivan's taking off, grew upon her. How readily
he had abandoned the suggestion of elopement! Abandon?
he had ignored it utterly. Not once in her conversation
with him had he put that forth as an explanation
worthy of investigation. Could it have been his subtle
purpose to interest her in a line of inquiry that should
lead directly away from that? A shiver passed over her
frame, and Louise inquired anxiously what was the matter?</p>

<p>"New theories keep occurring to me," responded Clara
gravely, "and each one is a shock worse than the one that
preceded it. Let me tell you this one. Suppose that Lizzie
White," Clara spoke with difficulty, every word seemingly
dragged forth by a violent effort, "suppose she were in
some way Poubalov's agent; I will not, cannot think that
Ivan went away with her, but might it not be possible
that this remarkable man, who has such mastery over ordinary
minds, had made her an accomplice? Don't you
see the cleverness of the plan? If Ivan was forced to go to
New York, Lizzie's departure for that city the same day
is immediately assumed by everybody to mean that they
eloped, and probably all in Boston who think of the matter
at all, suppose that they have been married. Ivan may
be a prisoner in New York, and Lizzie may be under Poubalov's
pay, or influence, the latter more likely, to act,
not as his jailer, but as a mask for his presence there.</p>

<p>"Poubalov has some object to attain in keeping him
thus guarded, to torture some political secret from him,
perhaps. Now what better could he do than divert suspicion
in my mind from Lizzie to those whom he calls Nihilists,
or even upon himself? He saw at first glance that I
would not tolerate the thought of an elopement as among
the possibilities, so he had no need to disarm me of suspicion
in that direction. Has not everything he has done been
done with a view to keeping me in Boston? What does he
care how much poor Litizki dogs his steps, so long as the
victim of his intrigue and villainy is hundreds of miles
away? His one fear in Boston is that Billings, whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
hired to help in the abduction, may confess something.
Therefore he tried to dog Billings' steps last night, and
whether he succeeded I do not know."</p>

<p>Much of this was Greek to Louise, and she said so, adding:
"What I do understand is that you feel now as if it
would be necessary to go to New York."</p>

<p>"I think so. We will see."</p>

<p>"Clara," said Louise, "you will not think that I have
suspected Ivan of faithlessness, I am sure; but it has
seemed to me that unless he returned soon, you would
have to go to Lizzie White. You cannot leave any possible
explanation unsought. I could not conjecture that she
and Poubalov might be concerned together as you have,
but I did feel as if you ought to look her up."</p>

<p>"I am glad you think so," responded Clara, "for I was
afraid you would oppose my going."</p>

<p>At the station Clara readily found the Mr. O'Brien to
whom Billings had referred for corroboration of a part
of his story.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," he said in reply to her questions, "I know the
Billings you speak of. I saw him here last Monday.
Has he been up to anything crooked?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Clara; "it may help to settle that if
you will tell me what were the circumstances of his call
here."</p>

<p>O'Brien hesitated.</p>

<p>"I don't want to get tangled up in any police business,"
he declared; "Billings was said to be the man who drove
the gent that skipped on his wedding day early this
week."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Clara; "I am Miss Hilman, and I was to
be married to the gentleman."</p>

<p>"Sho!" exclaimed O'Brien, sympathetically, "that
must have been a pretty tough blow," and he scratched
his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"My inquiry," continued Clara, "has nothing to do with
the police. They have abandoned the investigation, I believe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
I am trying simply to satisfy myself, and surely
you won't refuse to help."</p>

<p>"No, I won't," replied O'Brien; "but what I can say
won't do you no good. This was how it was. I had to go
out to the front of the depot for something, and just as
I got there, Billings drove up a closed carriage. I thought
he nodded as if he wanted me, so I stepped forward. He
pulled up further on than where carriages generally stop,
and was in a place all by himself. I was the only one near.
'Hello,' says I, 'how long you been driving?' 'Mind your
own business,' says he, and he whipped up and drove off.
While I was speaking to him a man had got out of the
carriage and gone into the depot. I didn't see him to know
him, didn't pay any attention to him, for he went
quickly, and I was wondering about Billings."</p>

<p>"He says you came forward to get his passenger's baggage."</p>

<p>"'Tain't so. That ain't my line of work."</p>

<p>"Didn't the passenger pay his fare?"</p>

<p>"Not there. He went straight into the depot."</p>

<p>"Why did you ask Billings that question?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I didn't know he'd got into the cab business.
He used to be a porter."</p>

<p>Clara thanked O'Brien, said she might call again if any
other questions occurred to her, and the young ladies went
on to Ashburton Place. Billings had lied, but it might
have been Ivan, nevertheless, who went into the station
from the closed carriage.</p>

<p>Mrs. White's greeting was marked by constraint, and
she sat in distressed silence for a moment after Clara and
Louise entered. At length she said:</p>

<p>"People will talk so! I'm sure you've been very good
and brave, Miss Hilman, but what is one to think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, Mrs. White."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you see, lots of my friends have called, seeing
Lizzie's name in the papers, and Mr. Strobel's, and
they will have it that they eloped."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Clara, and in spite of her
effort her tone was cold.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think," replied the landlady,
plaintively.</p>

<p>"You may think what you please," said Clara, her pride
mastering her diplomacy for the moment; "I am going to
New York to see your daughter. I called to say that you
might write to her freely so far as any wish of mine is
concerned, and to ask if I could take a look at Mr. Strobel's
room."</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Mrs. White, uncomfortably. She
longed to ask the imperious young lady a host of questions,
but she was restrained by Clara's hauteur.</p>

<p>The young ladies went up to Ivan's room, and found
there his trunk as he had left it, apparently, and everything
in just such condition as would be expected if a man
were about to move and were going to send for his effects
later.</p>

<p>When they went down again they found Litizki talking
with Mrs. White.</p>

<p>"So you are going to New York to-day?" he said with
some appearance of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Clara, "but I don't care to have that information
go further. Will you be careful, Mrs. White?
Forgive me if I seemed harsh just now. I shall say nothing
unkind to your daughter, and I believe less than ever that
she eloped with Mr. Strobel. What have you found?"
she asked, turning to Litizki.</p>

<p>"Billings doesn't live at that address," he replied,
"although he used to. He hasn't been about there for
some time, and no one in the neighborhood knew he was a
cab-driver."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Clara. "There is nothing more to do
in that direction for the present. I shall return from New
York on Saturday morning, probably. I should like to see
you then, if possible."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Hilman. What train are you to take? I might
have something to report to you at the last minute."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Clara reflected and answered:</p>

<p>"I shall have to go home first. I don't see how I can go
earlier than by the three o'clock New England train. Will
you be there?"</p>

<p>Litizki said he would, and after some further conversation
with Mrs. White the young ladies returned to Roxbury.
Louise did not prepare to go to New York, the extra
expense this journey involved deterring her, for Mr. Pembroke
was not one who reveled in great wealth. It was decided
to apprise him of Clara's coming by telegraph, so
that she would not be without escort in the city.</p>

<p>Litizki was at the train as he promised to be, and assisted
Clara to her seat in the drawing-room car. He lingered
until the starting signal had been given and then
said "good-by" and jumped off; but instead of remaining
in the depot, he ran forward and boarded the ordinary
smoking-car.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">LOUISE RECEIVES A CALLER.</p>


<p>Mr. Pembroke met Clara at the train when it arrived in
the Grand Central Depot promptly at nine o'clock. He was
plainly anxious, almost agitated.</p>

<p>"Tell me, child," he exclaimed, "why you have come?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't be satisfied," she replied, "without setting at
rest the rumors that connect Ivan's name with Lizzie
White."</p>

<p>"Oh," said her uncle, apparently relieved, "is that all?"</p>

<p>"All, uncle? Why, no, not if I find anything that leads
me to believe that Ivan is in New York. In that case I
shall search for him here. What did you think I had come
for?"</p>

<p>"I had nothing in mind except anxiety. When I received
your telegram, I feared something had happened. I
couldn't tell what. I have been so occupied with business
matters recently that I haven't been able to keep up with
you, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry to give you more trouble and anxiety,"
said Clara, with the sincerest contrition, "but I felt as if
I must come on."</p>

<p>"Let us go straight to the hotel," said Mr. Pembroke;
"I suppose there's nothing you want to do to-night?"</p>

<p>They had been standing on a station platform as they
talked, and not far away was Litizki, watching, trying to
listen, and wondering who the gentleman could be whom
Clara greeted so affectionately. He knew nothing about
her relationships, and supposed that Mr. Pembroke was
her father. He followed them and saw them enter a hack,
and he managed to get near enough to overhear Mr. Pembroke
say "Travelers' Hotel" to the driver. Not content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
with knowing the hotel, however, Litizki ran along the
sidewalk, keeping the vehicle in view all the way, and he
did not turn aside content until he saw by the departure
of the hack empty that Clara and her escort were both in
the hotel. Then he felt that she would be safe through the
night, for he was possessed of the idea that the powerful
Poubalov would follow her, and he feared that she would
come to harm at his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke had said little on the way from the depot
to the hotel, but when they were in the quiet of Clara's
room, he remarked:</p>

<p>"I suppose, my dear, that this coming to see Lizzie
White is the last step you will take in this matter, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell yet, uncle," she replied; "I do not see
why it should be, but, of course, I know so many things
connected with the case that I have had no opportunity to
tell you&mdash;things that I want to tell. I have needed somebody's
advice, so much, and I could not intrude on you
when you are so busy. I would not even now but that I
think you ought to know as much as I do of what has happened."</p>

<p>An expression of pain crossed Mr. Pembroke's features,
and he responded uneasily:</p>

<p>"Of course I want to help you, Clara, and I am more regretful
than I can possibly express that my business has
been in such shape."</p>

<p>"Are you seriously alarmed about it, uncle?"</p>

<p>"I was, but I think we shall pull through all right now.
Let us talk of your affairs. I would like to suggest, with
all sympathy, Clara, that the world in general, while it
would admire your loyalty if it understood it, would yet
do so in a pitying way that would be eminently distasteful
to you if on your own part you understood the world.
You see, you are regarded, no matter how unjustly, as
deserted. You have a remarkably clear head, and you
must see what I mean without putting me to the necessity
of using disagreeable terms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Clara flushed. She felt at that moment the full force of
the calamity that had overtaken her. While she was actively
at work building up theories, investigating clews,
and examining those who might throw light on the matter,
her grief had been measurably lightened. The thought
that she was working, however doubtfully, toward an end,
had enabled her to keep her emotions in control. Her uncle's
words, which were evidently but the preface to an
appeal to give up the struggle, reopened her wounds. It
was as if he had torn away the foundations of that structure
of the mind by which she had supported her heart.
With difficulty she restrained her tears, and responded:</p>

<p>"It would be better, uncle, to use plain language. Then
there would be no possible chance of a misunderstanding.
I know how I am looked upon, as deserted by my lover,
perhaps not for another woman, but at all events deserted
by him. The world will say that it would comport better
with womanly dignity to suffer in silence and solitude,
and that it is unmaidenly to pursue the man."</p>

<p>"You use harsher language than I would have used had
I spoken without consideration of your feelings," interposed
her uncle, nervously. His niece's faculty for manifesting
occasionally an imperious will, and of firmly maintaining
her own way without regard to general opinion,
had always been a bit of a terror to him. It was difficult
for him to reconcile it with her affectionate disposition,
her real consideration for the sufferings of others. He
could not see that in this matter, without the faintest
trace of egotism, she unconsciously measured her own
suffering as infinitely greater than that of anybody else
who was related to the case, and that she as unconsciously
asserted her right to minister to that suffering
in the way best calculated to alleviate it. Such characters
as hers, under the pressure of great trouble, elevate self-interest
to the very heights of nobility.</p>

<p>"I ask no consideration for my feelings," said Clara, almost
coldly; "it seems to me that real consideration would
credit me not only with dignified motives but with an intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
basis for my conduct. Uncle dear," and she suddenly
crossed to him and put her arms about his neck,
"let me take that back. I didn't mean it. I wouldn't for
the world say an unkind word to you, but you see I feel
my lonely position so keenly. I do what I think is right,
but there is no one to uphold me."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke disengaged her arms, and again the expression
of pain flitted across his face.</p>

<p>"I am doing as well as I can under the circumstances,"
he said huskily, "not only to show you my deep sympathy,
but to guide you also. For your own interests, I must
point out one possibility of your interview to-morrow. I
shall place no obstacle in the way of your seeing Lizzie
White, but I caution you, without knowing more about
her than that she left a good home, that she may take a
most unfriendly attitude. If there is anything unseemly in
the meeting, I know that it will arise from her. No one
can tell me that she lacks your native refinement; it must
be so; a woman such as she is at heart may make a dreadful
scene, whether she be interested in Ivan or not. To be
concerned in such a scene, my dear child, would be a
stigma from which even your goodness could not escape.
Clara, there is nothing so scandalous as a quarrel between
women when a man is in question."</p>

<p>"You wish me not to see her," said Clara, faintly.</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke rose and paced up and down in extreme
agitation for several minutes, while Clara sat with a
dreadful weight upon her heart; for she not only loved
her uncle, and wished earnestly to be guided by him if
possible, but she also realized that his warning was a wise
one. She had herself, with all her thought, scarcely considered
how she should approach Lizzie White. So certain
was she that Ivan had not eloped with her, that the interview
itself had not appealed to her as more than a friendly
discussion of facts and rumors as to which both would be
in accord. But there was her theory that Lizzie might be
an accomplice of Poubalov's. What attitude might she not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
take, therefore, in order to carry out her part in the spy's
design?</p>

<p>"I would say yes," declared Mr. Pembroke at length,
"for that is my wish, but I do not, cannot say it. Go to
this Lizzie White to-morrow, Clara. You will know how
to speak with her better than I can tell you. I will myself
go to the house with you, but you shall have your meeting
all alone if you so desire. Of course you do."</p>

<p>"Then, uncle," said Clara, "let me tell you of the
strange things that have occurred since I began to search
for Ivan. I am sure you will feel, when you know all, that
I am justified in my general course, however much I may
have been mistaken in details."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke listened with the closest attention to the
narrative. He was deeply moved by it, and when she had
finished he said brokenly:</p>

<p>"There is great villainy at work here."</p>

<p>Then he leaned his head upon his hand, shielding his
eyes from hers as she eagerly sought, not so much commendation
of her persistence as suggestion as to what to
do, or some theory upon which to explain the many mysteries
that centered upon the disappearance of Ivan.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he mused at last, "if this could have been
accident?"</p>

<p>"Accident, uncle!" exclaimed Clara, with just a touch
of impatience; "don't you see that if it had been accident,
we should have known of it? Think: in a busy street of a
city no accident could have occurred by which Ivan could
be incapacitated without some report of it coming to the
authorities. Even if Ivan had not been taken to a hospital
in the usual way, but had fallen into the hands of private
persons, it is not possible that with all the stir that was
made by his disappearance, police or reporters should not
have found some trace of him."</p>

<p>"True, true," said Mr. Pembroke, vacantly; "I was
thinking&mdash;you see it is hard to master all these strange
details at once. I marvel at your courage."</p>

<p>"Courage! What else could I do?" asked Clara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing with your character, nothing else. You have
done right, Clara. I am very tired. Let us talk further of
this in the morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke was not disposed to talk in the morning,
however, and Clara was engrossed with a long letter from
Louise that had been mailed on the train leaving Boston
at midnight.</p>

<p>"Poubalov," she wrote, "was at the house when I returned
from seeing you off. If the man were capable of expressing
emotion, I should say that he was disappointed
at not seeing you; but whatever he felt, he masked it under
his grand assumption of dignity and courtesy. He had
called, he said, to make his apologies for his extraordinary
leave-taking of the evening before, and also, he added
with ponderous humor, to recover his property. I got his
hat and cane for him, and what do you think! he had
brought a lovely basket of flowers for you, to plead his
apologies, as he put it. There was no refusing such an offering,
dear, and I am enjoying their fragrance and rich
colors as I write. I hope this will reach you in time to be
of use if Poubalov's call can be of use to you in New York.
I thought it my duty to report it. I felt how immeasurably
superior you are to me intellectually&mdash;I won't draw
other comparisons lest they be odious to one of us&mdash;for I
was utterly at a loss to draw him out. He didn't present
his excuses to me, and how he managed to evade doing so I
can't quite see now as I think it over, for he remained
several minutes, talking with apparent candor. The man
himself is as great a mystery as anything connected with
your trouble. All I can say is that with one hat on his
head, and his other hat and his cane in his hand, he eventually
took his departure, promising to call again. There is
one thing I managed not to do, though it was quite plain,
even to me, that he was trying to find out. I didn't tell him
where you were. Of course I had to say that you were not
at home, and in answer to direct questions that I did not
expect you before Saturday, but I didn't even hint at New
York or Lizzie White, and he made no allusion to either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Did I do right? I hope so, for I have felt so often what a
shame it is that I cannot be of more help to you. I believe
in Ivan as you do, dear, and my heart and thoughts
are with you."</p>

<p>They were at breakfast in the great dining-room of the
hotel when Clara read this letter, and she furtively kissed
the paper that conveyed such loyal sympathy to her. As
she replaced the letter in the envelope, she was surprised
to see the old man Dexter hobbling across the room.
There was an ugly scowl upon his face as he bowed to
her, and Mr. Pembroke rose from his chair with an expression
little less than fierce.</p>

<p>"Another time, Dexter," he exclaimed under his breath,
taking the old man by the arm and wheeling him around.
As Mr. Pembroke walked him away, Clara heard Dexter
croak:</p>

<p>"What is she here for, Mat Pembroke?"</p>

<p>When her uncle returned, his face was still dark and he
said:</p>

<p>"Business necessities, Clara, that sometimes compel a
man to tolerate disagreeable persons. I wouldn't have him
near you, however."</p>

<p>"He is disagreeable, surely," responded Clara, "but I
could have borne with him for your sake, uncle."</p>

<p>The subject seemed intensely disagreeable to Mr. Pembroke,
and nothing further was said about it.</p>

<p>After breakfast Mr. Pembroke inquired the number of
the house on Second Avenue from which Lizzie White had
written, and they set out to find it.</p>

<p>"I shall have to leave you, Clara," said her uncle, "as
soon as I am sure you have found the right place. I will
call for you or I will put a carriage at your disposal."</p>

<p>"There is no telling how long I shall be," returned
Clara, "and I don't see why you should need to inconvenience
yourself. I have acquired more self-dependence during
the last three or four days than I ever had before, and I
think you can trust me to take care of myself. But I
should think it would be well to have a carriage at command;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and, uncle, all the expense I have been to thus far
has come from my allowance. You will let me pay for a
carriage, won't you?"</p>

<p>"If you prefer to," said Mr. Pembroke, "and we will
engage one in the vicinity of the house as we can reach
the place readily by a cross-town line of cars."</p>

<p>So they proceeded by street-car, and when they alighted
in Second Avenue they were but a short distance from the
desired number. Mr. Pembroke signaled to a passing hack
and instructed the driver to wait near the house to which
they were going. Then they continued their way on foot.</p>

<p>Just before they came to the steps leading up to the door
their attention was attracted by the noise of a man running
behind them, and then a voice panting, "Miss Hilman!
Miss Hilman!"</p>

<p>They turned about quickly, and, to her unspeakable surprise,
Clara saw that it was Litizki. His sallow face was
flushed with the exertion of his long run, for he had
chased them afoot from the hotel. He could hardly speak
for lack of breath when he came up to them, but he did
manage to gasp:</p>

<p>"I've seen him, Miss Hilman, this morning!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">LIZZIE WHITE.</p>


<p>Clara clutched her uncle's arm convulsively and leaned
heavily upon him.</p>

<p>"You have seen Mr. Strobel?" she whispered.</p>

<p>All the color fled from Litizki's face as he realized how
woefully he had put his foot in it. In the intensity of his
hate for Poubalov and his distrust of him, he had forgotten
for the moment that the spy was but a secondary figure
in the drama they were enacting. Clara saw in the little
tailor's distressed expression that she had interpreted
his words erroneously. The double shock well nigh unnerved
her.</p>

<p>"Let us walk on a little way," she said faintly. Stuyvesant
Square was near by, and Mr. Pembroke led her
within the gates and sat with her upon a bench. Litizki
followed humbly, suffering miserably from his indiscreet
zeal, and Clara told her uncle who he was. Mr. Pembroke
asked:</p>

<p>"Well, my man, who is it you have seen?"</p>

<p>"Alexander Poubalov, sir," he replied with his eyes
upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Strange!" said Mr. Pembroke, turning to his niece;
"did you tell him you were coming to New York?"</p>

<p>"No; I didn't mean that he should know it. He called
at the house yesterday after I had gone, and Louise writes
that she withheld any definite information about my
whereabout."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke looked inquiringly at Litizki.</p>

<p>"I came on yesterday by the same train that brought
Miss Hilman," he said, "for I didn't know that there was
anybody in New York to watch out for her. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
nothing for me to do in Boston, and I was afraid for her.
Neither of you know this man Poubalov as I do. I should
say that he had the gift of second sight, but I don't believe
in the supernatural. He is not only a master of deceit,
but he has marvelous powers of discernment. I was
certain that he would pursue Miss Hilman, and I wanted
to do what I could to protect her."</p>

<p>"Mr. Litizki has been very kind and faithful, uncle,"
said Clara; "you remember that I told you about him."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Pembroke, to whom the idea of his
beautiful niece under the watchful eye of such an unprepossessing
man was distasteful. "How did you come to
see Poubalov?"</p>

<p>"I went to the hotel very early this morning," was the
reply, "and hung around where I could keep all the doors
in view. Poubalov turned up about half-past seven. He
was walking very rapidly. He went first into the hotel
near yours, and I saw him examining the register at the
clerk's desk. Presently, with the same hurried strides, he
came out and went into the Travelers'. There he looked
over several pages of the register, and when he had finished
he strolled to the door leisurely. All his hurry was
gone, and after pausing to light a cigarette, he went
slowly down the avenue. I remained to give warning to
Miss Hilman. I didn't know your name, sir, or I would
have sent for you, and I couldn't get a chance to say a
word until just now. I am very sorry that I gave Miss Hilman
a wrong impression."</p>

<p>"Don't think of it, Mr. Litizki," said Clara, who was
rapidly recovering her accustomed calmness; "it is all
over now. You see, uncle, how strangely I am beset.
There is no doubt, from Poubalov's actions, that he has
followed me here. What is his purpose? To put Lizzie
White on her guard? Then he has circumvented me, for
he has had nearly two hours in which to act since he
found from the register that you were staying at the Travelers',
and perhaps my name, too, was on the book."</p>

<p>"Yes, I put it there myself, last night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Clara rose and extended her hand to Litizki.</p>

<p>"You are a faithful friend," she said, "and I am very
glad you told me this. I shall be the more satisfied with
my talk with Miss White now, for I shall be able to ask
questions that otherwise might not have occurred to me."</p>

<p>Litizki mumbled some words of acknowledgment of
her kindness, and Mr. Pembroke asked anxiously whether
she felt strong enough to proceed with her programme.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered bravely; "you won't need to
wait longer. I will take the carriage afterward and Mr.
Litizki, I suppose, won't be far away if I need escort."</p>

<p>"I shall not be far from you at any time," said the
tailor.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad when you are through with it," sighed
Mr. Pembroke. "I will accompany you as far as the house
as I at first intended."</p>

<p>Litizki hung back as they started and remained within
the entrance to the park until he saw them mount the
steps, and until Mr. Pembroke had gone down again, leaving
Clara in the house.</p>

<p>The servant who answered the ring had readily admitted
that Miss White lived there, and had invited the callers to
enter. She ushered Clara into a small reception-room, and,
without asking her name, went to find Lizzie. Clara sat
down to wait, feeling more perturbation than she had experienced
at any time since her trouble began. She had
not long to pass in painful speculations, for Lizzie White
promptly responded to the summons.</p>

<p>"I supposed it was you," she said with a hard, resentful
tone as she entered the room.</p>

<p>Lizzie would have been a comely girl if her rather sharp
features had been softened by a pleasant expression. On
the contrary, disappointment and bitterness dwelt in her
eyes and drew down the corners of her mouth. She was
dressed as a domestic servant, wearing a white cap and
apron. She held an open letter in her hand, and sat down
in the nearest chair without making the slightest advance
to the kindly greeting that was upon Clara's lips as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
rose. It was as if she expected a disagreeable scene, and
was determined not only to see it through, but to contribute
her full share to its unpleasantness.</p>

<p>Clara's greeting was unuttered.</p>

<p>"Why did you think it was I?" she asked.</p>

<p>"This," said Lizzie, indicating the letter; "it's from
mother."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you I was coming?"</p>

<p>"No, but she tells me how you've hunted for Mr. Strobel,
and how people say he went away with me. I knew
well enough you'd come on here to find him."</p>

<p>"It is hardly correct," said Clara, gently, "to say that I
came on to find him, though I would go anywhere to do
so."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess you would."</p>

<p>Lizzie was relentless. Her tone spoke determination to
make Miss Hilman suffer to the utmost. Clara conquered
the emotions that Lizzie stirred within her, and added:</p>

<p>"From the start, Lizzie, I have steadfastly denied that
Mr. Strobel went away with you, or that your departure
had to do with his disappearance. Please understand me:
I did not expect to find Mr. Strobel with you. If I had
thought differently, I should not have come."</p>

<p>Lizzie laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you would have known that you were
too late. You are very brilliant, Miss Hilman, but I guess
you're finding that it takes more than that to hold a
man."</p>

<p>This was as bad as anything that Clara had anticipated
as among the possibilities of the conversation; but, holding
her great purpose firmly in mind, she persisted in continuing
the interview. Suffer insult she must, but she
would not give up without obtaining some manner of
information.</p>

<p>"For your own good name, Lizzie&mdash;&mdash;" began Clara, but
the girl interrupted hotly:</p>

<p>"My good name! what have you to do with it, I should
like to know? I hadn't seen any Boston papers, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
didn't know until I got this letter that the whole city had
talked about me. They have said that I eloped with Mr.
Strobel, and that settles it, I suppose. Why didn't you let
mother write to me the day she received my letter?"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask her not to write," replied Clara, feeling a
little guilty at the thrust; perhaps she had gone too far in
influencing the communication between mother and
daughter, setting her own anxieties and griefs above
theirs. "I asked her not to mention Mr. Strobel's disappearance,
and she chose herself not to write at all. I did
so because I confidently expected to obtain proofs in the
evening that he could not have gone with you."</p>

<p>"Then you did think so!" cried Lizzie triumphantly;
"you did fear, at least, that all your education and money
and high society ways were not enough to keep him from
falling in love with a poor girl who has no position!"</p>

<p>"I had no such thought," returned Clara, greatly distressed;
"I did think that you would be happier to know
that such a thought could not occur to me, as you would
know if the circumstances were such as to prove that Mr.
Strobel could not have come to New York."</p>

<p>"Me, happy!" exclaimed Lizzie, bitterly, and then in
the same breath&mdash;"You found it quite possible that he
could have come, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Ignoring the last part of her remark, Clara quickly took
her cue from the first, and said very gently:</p>

<p>"Your mother showed me your letter in which you said
you could be almost happy."</p>

<p>The color rushed to Lizzie's cheeks as she replied:</p>

<p>"Mother ought to have known better."</p>

<p>Then she shut her lips hard together, and it was plain
that she was obstinately determined to say no more on
that subject.</p>

<p>"I have sincerely tried," said Clara, "to think and act in
a friendly way, Lizzie."</p>

<p>"Friendly with a rival!" and again Lizzie laughed with
bitter scorn.</p>

<p>"I should not need the evidence of your words," responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Clara, "to convince me that there never was any
rivalry between us."</p>

<p>She rose to go, and Lizzie looked at her with startled
eyes. Was this to be the end of the conversation? Clara
was the picture of haughty pride, unmoved apparently by
any of the thrusts that Lizzie had tried to make so cruel.
Jealously insensible to Clara's kindly advances, Lizzie was
completely overcome by her manifestation of calm superiority.
She bit her lip and crumpled her mother's letter
in her hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Strobel is not here," she said, and her voice broke
as if the words choked her.</p>

<p>"I know it," remarked Clara, coolly, with her hand
upon the door.</p>

<p>"Miss Hilman! don't go yet!"</p>

<p>There was the sign of coming tears in Lizzie's eyes, and
Clara looked down upon her pityingly.</p>

<p>Lizzie made one last effort to recall her determination to
be bitter, and compel her visitor to suffer as she suffered,
but hers was not the strength of character to meet emergencies,
overcome difficulties, and play a part unswayed
by her deeper, genuine devotions. She extended her arms
upon the table before her, and, laying her head upon them,
burst into passionate crying. Clara laid her hand caressingly
on Lizzie's head and waited until the first storm of
sobs had begun to subside. Then she said in a quiet but
not unkind voice:</p>

<p>"Lizzie, have you seen Alexander Poubalov this morning?"</p>

<p>The girl half raised her head, choked back the sobs and
replied, "Who?" Clara repeated the name distinctly.</p>

<p>"I don't know who he is," answered Lizzie, wearily.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," asked Clara, "the gentleman who
called on Mr. Strobel the morning he was to be married?"</p>

<p>"I remember somebody called," said Lizzie, absently,
"mother showed him up. I didn't see him. What has he
got to do with it?"</p>

<p>Clara felt that she must believe the girl, but she made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
one further move to discover whether in any way she
might be allied with Poubalov.</p>

<p>"Has anybody been to see you this morning?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Lizzie; "what has this man you mention
got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Everything, I think," said Clara. "It looks as if he
had caused Mr. Strobel's disappearance, abducted him in
fact, and I know that he followed me to New York."</p>

<p>Lizzie was not keen enough to see that Clara had inferred
a possible collusion between herself and Poubalov.</p>

<p>"Then," she said, "Mr. Strobel did not desert you at
all!" and the tears welled from her eyes afresh. Clara
knew that she would speak further, and after a moment,
with her face in her hand, Lizzie moaned: "I am very unhappy,
Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>"You must be, Lizzie," returned Clara, caressing her,
"and I don't ask you to tell me anything. I am sorry I
had to break in on you; but if you understood how I have
been more than puzzled by the strange conduct of Mr. Strobel's
enemy, you would forgive me."</p>

<p>"Forgive? Why, Miss Hilman, it is my place to ask for
forgiveness. I was so brutal when you first came in.
Don't you see, I," her voice faltered pitiably but she continued
desperately, "I loved Mr. Strobel before he ever
met you, I think. He never mentioned love to me, but he
was so good and kind that I foolishly thought he was fond
of me. I suffered horribly when he told us of his engagement,
and I couldn't get over it. I thought of running
away many times, but I couldn't bring myself to do so
while he was still with us. I thought perhaps I would feel
differently after he was gone, but on that morning when
he was getting ready for the church, I simply couldn't endure
the thought of staying in the house any longer. So I
came away. I hadn't made any preparation. I took the
first train I could get, and while I was waiting I wrote a
note to mother. Did you see it? No? I started to tell her
why I went, but I couldn't, and I scratched the words out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
I knew one friend in New York, and she got me employment
here, where I thought I could work hard and forget.
I hadn't heard a word of Mr. Strobel's disappearance until
I got mother's letter. Then&mdash;then I felt somehow as if it
was my revenge, and I think I hated you as much for
your suffering as I did because you won his love."</p>

<p>Clara heard this painful confession with an aching
heart. Her sympathies were deeply touched by the artlessness
with which this unhappy girl had developed bitterness
and discontent from her love that it might take a
lifetime of toil to soften.</p>

<p>"We both suffer, Lizzie," she said gravely; "I am glad
now that I came. Shall I tell your mother anything?"</p>

<p>"No! no! I will write what's necessary. You can say
that I am in a good family, and that some day I shall visit
her."</p>

<p>Lizzie looked appealingly at Clara as if she would have
her remain longer, but no good end was to be accomplished
by prolonging the interview, and Clara withdrew.</p>

<p>As she stepped into the waiting carriage, she beckoned
to Litizki who stood near the next corner.</p>

<p>"I am going to the hotel," she said, "and as soon as I
can I shall take the train for Boston. Will you get in?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Miss Hilman," replied Litizki,
abashed. "I will return by street-car. If you could let me
know what train you intend to take, I should like it."</p>

<p>"There's a train at noon. If I can see my uncle I will
take that."</p>

<p>She was driven away, and Litizki, head down, gloomy,
more and more impressed with the conviction that Poubalov
was not only responsible for Strobel's disappearance,
but that he also plotted evil to Clara, slowly left the
vicinity. When he was well out of the way, Alexander
Poubalov left the window of a room he had hired two hours
earlier, directly across the street from the house where
Lizzie White lived, and came out upon the sidewalk. After
a quick glance up and down the avenue, he went over the
way, rang the bell, and asked to see Miss White.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">HOW LITIZKI SAVED MISS HILMAN.</p>


<p>The ladies' entrance to the Travelers' Hotel was upon the
same street as the main corridor, almost next door to it.
Clara glanced in as the carriage slowly passed the open
doors and she saw her uncle at the further end, pacing
slowly toward her. Two men were with him whom she did
not at the moment recognize, but so anxious was she to
have a word with him that when she alighted, instead of
going in at the ladies' entrance, she stepped over to the
main doorway and stood there to attract his attention as
soon as he should come near.</p>

<p>He saw her immediately and quickened his pace. In
that instant she saw that one of the other men was Dexter,
and that he wheeled abruptly about, turning the
third man around with him. Dexter hobbled back toward
the clerk's desk and led his companion out of sight into a
passage that terminated in the corridor. Clara saw this
maneuver but dimly, as her attention was fixed upon her
uncle, whose face had the haggard, anxious expression
that she had noticed on it several times of late. He was
quickly beside her, and attributing his anxiety largely to
herself, she smiled bravely and said:</p>

<p>"There was no scandal, uncle, and very little of what
you could call a scene."</p>

<p>"You are back sooner than I thought for," he responded
with something of an effort. "Did you see anything?"</p>

<p>"Of Poubalov? No."</p>

<p>"I mean Strobel."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I am convinced that Lizzie knows nothing of
him, poor girl!"</p>

<p>"So am I," said Mr. Pembroke with a deep sigh; "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
have had no time, of course, to give the matter much
thought, but my impression is, and it grows constantly
stronger, that you will eventually find Strobel in Boston."</p>

<p>"And do you think I shall find him, uncle?" asked
Clara, eager for encouraging words.</p>

<p>"I hope so, my child, I hope so. It does not seem possible
that this affair will resolve itself into an unfathomable
mystery. There are few such things in real life, you
know, and if the worst had happened to Strobel, we would
have heard of it."</p>

<p>"It gives me new courage to hear you say so," said
Clara looking wistfully at her uncle, "I wanted to speak
to you simply to let you know that nothing troublesome
has happened, and that it is my intention to return to Boston
as soon as possible, though I don't know what I can
do after I get there."</p>

<p>"I would rest if I were you, Clara."</p>

<p>"I cannot think of rest now. We will see. Something
may happen to give me a fresh start, or I may discover a
new clew in something I already know, the significance of
which I have overlooked."</p>

<p>"Don't try to do too much; rest if you can," pleaded
Mr. Pembroke. "I shall return myself to-night."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to wait and go with you?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," exclaimed her uncle, hastily; "you'll find
the journey nothing by daylight, and it might be fatiguing
at night. You are familiar with it, and don't mind
traveling alone for so short a time, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I merely thought you might want me to
wait."</p>

<p>"No, Dexter will have to be with me. I will be with you
at home in time for breakfast. You'll take the noon train
I suppose? Good-by."</p>

<p>Haste was evident in Mr. Pembroke's manner as well as
in his words, and Clara bade him good-by at once. She
went to her room for her traveling bag, and when she returned
to the carriage Litizki was waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Is it the noon train, Miss Hilman?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she answered; "won't you ride to the station
with me?"</p>

<p>"Do you wish it?" said the little tailor, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Of course I do. Come, there may be things we wish to
tell each other."</p>

<p>So Litizki sat beside her on the way to the station, and
after the carriage started he said:</p>

<p>"Miss Hilman, I shrink from asking questions, and yet
I think you will admit that I have more than curiosity
about the result of your call on Miss White."</p>

<p>"You have every right to know," she responded; "we
talked very frankly after a while, and I came away satisfied
that she is not an accomplice of Poubalov's."</p>

<p>Litizki stared out of the window in silence for a time,
and finally spoke much as if he were addressing himself:</p>

<p>"When Miss Hilman says she is satisfied, it goes a great
way to convince me."</p>

<p>"You are still in doubt, then?" asked Clara.</p>

<p>"I cannot help being so. Poubalov grows upon me until
he is ever present in my mind, like a horrid nightmare.
At every step we take it is Poubalov. If ever anything is
discovered, you discover Poubalov's hand in it. Whenever
we make an attempt to gain a point, we are frustrated,
and it is Poubalov who stands over and above, in and
through all, moving us with his master-hand, and setting
up obstacles when we would move of our own will. We
are at the mercy of him who knows no mercy, and so long
as Poubalov remains&mdash;in America, we are without hope,
unless he accomplishes his purpose and has no further use
for Mr. Strobel."</p>

<p>Litizki spoke with profound melancholy and just that
touch of extravagance in language that Clara had noticed
the first time she saw him in Mrs. White's.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," she said, "that you estimate Poubalov's
power for evil so greatly, and it would be folly for
the friends of Mr. Strobel to underestimate him; and
yet, with a woman's imperfect reasoning, I feel that we
shall some day outreach him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is nothing imperfect in your reasoning, Miss
Hilman," and for once Litizki addressed her directly, his
gloomy eyes fixed upon her own; "but you are speaking
from the kindness of your heart rather than from the logic
of your brain. This is not my first experience with Poubalov.
But no matter." He turned away abruptly and again
gazed out of the window. "It is nothing short of greatness
in you," he continued presently, "in the midst of
your sorrow to try to throw a little light into my life.
Every kind word and every encouragement from you hurts
me almost as much as the oppression and injustice from
which I have suffered all my life. Until I knew Mr. Strobel
I knew not real kindness. I am yet unused to it, and
so it seems sometimes as if you had stabbed me. But there
is this difference, Miss Hilman: Whereas constant injustice
deadens the heart, kindness quickens it, and I shall
yet do something, you may be sure, that will not only be
evidence of my sincerity and devotion, but that will actually
help you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Litizki," returned Clara, disturbed by his morbid
tone rather than by his words, which were but characteristic
of his point of view, "you dwell too much upon these
things, not only upon what has been evilly done to you,
but upon what seems to you as exceptional goodness. Let
us not think more about it until the time comes for action.
Then we shall be the better prepared to think quickly
and effectively. See, here we are at the depot. I will let
you get my ticket for me, as you will have to go to the
window also, and I will avoid the nuisance of having to
wait in the line."</p>

<p>Litizki took her purse without a word, after she had
settled with the driver, escorted her to a seat and then
went to the ticket window. When he returned he displayed
unusual coolness, for him, as he handed her the
ticket and said:</p>

<p>"Poubalov will go by the same train as you. He is even
now in this room, and he saw me buy the tickets. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
course I pretended not to see him, but he despises me and
cares not for all my efforts."</p>

<p>Clara felt no fear at this information, but it nevertheless
aroused a sense of discomfort. A presentiment of misfortune
she readily dismissed; this fact of being persistently
"shadowed" by a man whom she believed to be her
enemy she could not dismiss, and she could not shake off
the irritation caused by it.</p>

<p>"Suppose," suggested Litizki, "that you pretend to
take this train but really wait for the next one."</p>

<p>"No," replied Clara, "I will not be interfered with in
my movements by Poubalov. I suppose it is his right to
take the train, if he chooses to do so, as well as it is mine.
I will go to my car now, please, and if he ventures to intrude
upon me I shall know how to relieve myself of his
presence."</p>

<p>Litizki's eyes sparkled with exultant satisfaction for
just an instant, and then the fire that lit them subsided to
a steady glow that would have revealed a fixed and awful
purpose had anybody seen it and read it correctly. But he
kept his eyes averted as he escorted Clara to the car,
thinking of her words, weighing them, repeating them to
himself. They sank deep into his brain, where his perceptions
of life, disordered by a rankling sense of injustice,
distorted them and threw them back to the surface of his
thoughts with an interpretation all his own.</p>

<p>"She has the nature of heroes," he said to himself,
"and she is capable of it! She is great, grand! How fitting
that Alexander Poubalov should meet at last a foe of infinite
spirit, intellect as keen as his own, courage unfaltering,
and that foe a woman! But she is a woman, and her
place is beside my benefactor. She must be saved for him
and for herself. She must be spared this demonstration of
her right to rank with heroes. I know what she is, and
Strobel shall know when, Poubalov out of the way, he
gains his freedom. She must be saved, and I must save
her. It is my fate!"</p>

<p>Wholly unsuspicious of the raving that was going on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
her strange companion's mind, Clara proceeded to the car
and took the chair that the porter pointed out to her. For
just an instant it occurred to her to ask Litizki to sit with
her, but there was nothing Quixotic in her character; she
knew that the little tailor would be immeasurably hurt if
she should suggest paying his traveling expenses, and,
withal, he made her uncomfortable. She thought very
kindly of him, but she felt no need of his protection.</p>

<p>"We will meet again in Boston," she said, pleasantly,
"and we may yet do some work together."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," responded Litizki. "I shall be on the
train, and if you like I will watch outside till it starts and
let you know whether Poubalov gets on board."</p>

<p>"It's hardly necessary," said Clara; "still, if you would
rather do so, I have no objection."</p>

<p>Litizki, therefore, loitered on the platform beside the
train until just before starting time. Then he went to
Clara and told her that Poubalov had taken a seat in the
car just behind hers.</p>

<p>"I have no fear," she assured him, "but you may look
for me when we get to Boston."</p>

<p>She made this arrangement wholly for his sake, realizing
the man's devotion and anxiety to serve her. He
bowed gravely and made his way to the platform again,
but instead of going to an ordinary coach he climbed the
steps to the rear platform of the parlor car in which Poubalov
sat.</p>

<p>"Can you give me a seat in this car?" he asked of the
conductor as the train started.</p>

<p>"There's just one left," replied the official as he consulted
his slips after a curious glance at the inquirer.</p>

<p>Litizki paid for the seat immediately. It was at the very
back of the car, against the partition of the smoking room
wherein Poubalov was at the time seeking the comfort he
found in cigarettes.</p>

<p>The train had been in motion more than an hour when
Poubalov appeared. He saw Litizki, and raised his brows
slightly, as if in mild surprise. With no other sign of recognition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
he took his seat, which was in about the middle
of the car.</p>

<p>Hours passed slowly while the train rushed on as if
madly intent upon checking the flight of time. Poubalov
occupied himself with a book. Litizki could not have followed
the words on a printed page had he tried to do so.
His brain worked over and over the idea that had found
its way there days before, and he could not, if he would,
have thought of anything else.</p>

<p>"The time matters not," he argued with himself; "as
well now as at another, but there must be provocation if
possible. If there is no provocation, then proceed without
it. It must be done at all hazard. And there must be no
failure."</p>

<p>Somewhere between Westerly and Providence the train
came to a stop. There was trouble with the engine&mdash;what,
it matters not. The train could not proceed until the damage
had been repaired. A brakeman was sent forward to
the next station to telegraph for assistance, and the engineer
busied himself in effecting a temporary adjustment
of the machinery, so that some progress could be made
even though it were slow. Poubalov went forward with
many passengers to watch the work, and Litizki followed
him. Altogether nearly two hours were lost by the accident,
so that it was dark when the train rushed through
the suburbs of Boston.</p>

<p>Poubalov then rose and went into the car forward. Litizki
went after and saw the spy drop into a chair not
far from where Clara sat, her back to the window, her
profile clearly in view. There were many vacant seats in
the car, some unoccupied at the moment because the passengers,
weary with the long journey, were standing up,
making early preparations for departure. All the men
were at the forward end, waiting their turns at the wash-room.</p>

<p>The train had just rolled past Roxbury crossing, two
miles from the terminus, when Poubalov rose again and
sauntered forward, sinking negligently into the chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
back of Clara which had just been vacated by a lady who
was now submitting to the brush of the porter.</p>

<p>Litizki saw Clara start when Poubalov addressed her,
and his hand sought his pocket, but he withdrew it
empty when he observed that the spy had left his cane
leaning against the side of the car near his former seat.</p>

<p>"That will do better," muttered the tailor, and he went
to Poubalov's chair, took the cane in his hands, and, all
unobserved by any of the preoccupied passengers, released
the catch and drew forth the long blade. Concealing it by
his side as he took the few remaining steps that lay between
him and his victim, he presently raised it high over
Poubalov's heart, and with the words, "I will do it for
you, Miss Hilman!" brought it down with all his force.</p>

<p>Poubalov fell into the aisle with a loud gasp, and Clara,
uttering one scream of terror, bent over him.</p>

<p>Litizki dashed to the rear platform. There was nobody
in his way save one or two frightened women. The brakeman
had already opened the doors of the vestibuled platform
and before any one could lay hands upon him, the
little tailor had swung himself off into the darkness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE KEY TO IVAN'S PRISON.</p>


<p>The train was proceeding at such comparatively slow
speed that Litizki, though he had jumped blindly and
though he fell full length on the ground, was not hurt. Before
the rear car had passed he was on his feet and making
across the tracks. A fence too high for him to scale
barred his progress, and he hurried in the direction of
Roxbury, looking for some means of egress from the
"yard" through which the railroad ran. He found it at
last, a narrow gate in the fence at the end of a short
street. The gate was unlocked, and Litizki was soon upon
Columbus Avenue.</p>

<p>Until then he had been conscious of no especial emotion,
and his course had been taken instinctively rather than
with a definite purpose of effecting his escape; but instead
of breathing free now that he was where for a time at
least he could mingle with the passers unsuspected, a
great fear came upon him. Throughout all the long journey
he had nursed his awful purpose calmly and steadfastly,
never for an instant wavering; now he seemed still
to feel the handle of the dagger in his palm, he saw the
blade flash as he poised it over Poubalov's heart, and he
heard again the loud gasp with which the spy fell under
the blow. Litizki trembled. His throat was parched, his
skin hot, but dry as the dust on the pavement. He glanced
furtively up and down the avenue, as if to see the policeman
who would presently arrest him.</p>

<p>Litizki had paused, unable to walk without staggering,
when he dropped so completely from heroism to trepidation.
He grasped a trolley post for support and was dimly
conscious that two or three girls who were passing
laughed at him for being helplessly drunk. Half unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
he felt in his pocket and drew forth the revolver
with which he had intended to kill the spy. Should he
not end his misery then and there, and cheat the hangman?
He looked down at the tiny barrel, so large in its
tragic possibilities, and with the thought that he had but
to exercise a steady hand upon himself as he had upon
Poubalov in order to plunge into oblivion, he began to recover.
The grated cover of a sewer basin was at his feet
and he dropped the weapon upon it. It rebounded a very
little and then slipped through the grating, out of sight
and out of reach. Litizki instantly wondered why he had
done that.</p>

<p>"That was unreasonable. The revolver was not evidence,"
he muttered, and then a wild joy surged in his
heart as he reflected that he had accomplished his purpose.</p>

<p>"That was no crime in the light of reason," he argued.
"The necessities of the situation demanded it, and though
the law will say otherwise, I am content."</p>

<p>He was almost himself again now, and it flashed upon
him that his work, after all, was but half done. There was
one other step to be taken before his heroic deed could be
of service to her whom he worshiped, and to his benefactor
whom he idolized. Strobel must be freed, but how?
Certainly not by standing there at the curb in plain view,
waiting to be arrested. No; whatever be his ultimate fate,
he must effect at least a temporary escape.</p>

<p>Once more steadied by a purpose to strive for, Litizki
crossed the avenue and walked on in the same general direction
until he came to Washington Street. His delay at
the curb had been brief as measured by the watch. With
every step he took his brain grew clearer. He saw the
folly of going to Poubalov's lodging-house in Bulfinch
Place for the purpose of releasing Strobel. His conviction
that Strobel was confined there had not been shaken by
any of the events since his failure to expose Poubalov's secret.
News of the murder would undoubtedly be taken to
that house before he could get there. The release must be
effected by some other hand than his own; but what matter?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
He had made the release possible. Miss Hilman
would ever give him credit for it, and that was enough, as
undoubtedly she would tell Strobel how it came to pass.</p>

<p>His plan of operation was fully formed when he
reached Washington Street. He boarded the first Chelsea
ferry car that came along, and set himself to thinking of it.
When the conductor touched his shoulder to remind him
of his fare, he started violently as if the avenging hand of
law had been laid upon him. There was a recurrence of
the dreadful fear that had momentarily possessed him, and
again he shook as if with an ague. He felt an almost irresistible
impulse to jump from the car and run; and when
at last he left it, near the far end of Hanover Street, he
had not yet recovered. With great difficulty he dragged
his steps through the crowded streets of the North End
until he came to the house where Vargovitch lived. As he
climbed the stairs, he felt his courage return; and when
Vargovitch bade him enter, he was again the somber,
depressed figure with which all his acquaintances were familiar.</p>

<p>"Vargovitch," he said directly but with averted eyes,
"I leave the country to-morrow, never to return. Do not
ask me why. You will know soon enough after I have
gone. See, I have so much money," and he emptied the
contents of his purse upon the table. "It is enough for the
present, perhaps, but I shall some day need more, and I
leave behind me accounts and stock, to say nothing of
business good will, that are of value. I want you to help
me realize upon them."</p>

<p>Vargovitch looked sternly at his friend.</p>

<p>"That mad head of yours," he responded, "has led you
at last to difficulty from which there is no exit. I will ask
no questions, Litizki, but I will not be concerned in your
affair. You should not have come here."</p>

<p>Litizki was sufficiently master of himself to repress the
tremor that threatened him.</p>

<p>"Do you desert me, Vargovitch?" he asked, turning his
dull eyes apathetically on his comrade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll accept no responsibility for what you may have
done," returned Vargovitch, "I will neither harbor you
nor inform upon you."</p>

<p>"I do not ask the one, and I know you would not do the
other. I shall remain but a short time. Come! will you
take my business and dispose of it for me?"</p>

<p>"Money cannot be raised among our people to-night."</p>

<p>"I know it, but you can send me some when you have
collected. Let me sit down and write a moment."</p>

<p>Vargovitch silently placed writing materials before
him, and Litizki wrote rapidly. When he had done, he
handed the paper to his friend. It was a surrender of all
his business property to Vargovitch, as complete a bill of
sale as he could draw.</p>

<p>"Take it or destroy it," said Litizki; "I go now, and by
and by I shall send you my address. If you have accepted
the trust I impose upon you, you will send me money; if
not&mdash;" The tailor shrugged his shoulders and went to
the door. "It is the last time you look upon me, Vargovitch,"
he concluded.</p>

<p>"It is a wild scheme," muttered Vargovitch, looking at
the document, "but we will see."</p>

<p>The noise of the door closing aroused him. Litizki had
left the room.</p>

<p>On the street Litizki again had to struggle against the
fear that his crime excited. All through the long night it
came to him at irregular intervals, and he vibrated between
an exaltation when he regarded himself as a hero,
and abject cowardice when the rustling of a leaf made
his very soul shiver. On this occasion, that is, after leaving
Vargovitch, he staggered through unfamiliar streets
and alleys, hoping that no friend would see him, and at
length during a period of self-possession, he crossed the
ferry to East Boston. There he took a room in an emigrant's
hotel near the Cunard steamship dock. He knew
that some boat of this line would depart on the morrow,
the regular sailing day, and he had resolved to take passage
in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>In the office of the hotel he found that the boat was the
Cephalonia, and that she was scheduled to start at half-past
eleven. That was a late hour, and he would be in
great peril until then, but there was nothing for it but to
take his chances. So he gathered up a lot of writing materials
and retired to his room. He spent most of the night
in writing to Clara.</p>

<p>"In staying your hand," he began abruptly, without
address of any sort, "from exacting from Alexander Poubalov
the penalty of his crime against you, the penalty
which your hand alone was worthy to exact, I was impelled
not by egotism, or sudden emotion. It was my purpose
to save you for a happier career than with all your
nobility of character you could have achieved had you
yourself done the deed. I shall try to escape the punishment
that society would inflict upon me for this act of
justice, for I find that at this moment I cling to my miserable
life as does the dog whose master starves and maltreats
him. If I do not escape, it will matter not at all,
and I ask no tears from your beautiful eyes. I know your
character so well that I shall die content with the gratitude
that I know will warm your heart for your unworthy
servant.</p>

<p>"The blow that struck away the mighty obstacle to your
success and happiness was but the key to the door that is
closed upon Ivan Strobel. The happiness of opening that
door with my own hands is not to be for me, and I do not
deserve it. I am content to show you the way.</p>

<p>"Poubalov's rooms are at 32 Bulfinch Place. He occupies
two, possibly three rooms there, and in the sense that he
has undoubtedly bought the landlady, the whole house is
his. I am convinced that Strobel is confined there, and
that that has been his prison house since his abduction
last Monday. There will be no bar now to your going to
the house and releasing your lover and my benefactor. I
will tell you what room he is in, or at all events was in
last Thursday night; and that you may thoroughly understand
me, I will relate how I came to know this, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
in so doing I shall lay bare to you the secrets of my heart
and confess to you the weak, good-for-nothing that I am&mdash;such
as you yourself have found me to be. I hope my action
of this evening will redeem me somewhat in your
eyes."</p>

<p>Here followed a detailed account of Litizki's attempted
rescue of Strobel, and he mitigated none of the mortifying
occurrences, freely confessing himself a child in the hands
of his adversary.</p>

<p>"The room where Strobel was confined on that night,"
he continued, "is the little one adjoining Poubalov's main
room. It is directly over the hall as you enter, one flight
up. I doubt very much whether Poubalov has transferred
his prisoner to any other part of the house, for that would
have provoked comment and perhaps suspicion among the
lodgers. Your happiness, therefore, is now in your own
hands, and if I escape I shall never see you again. I could
almost wish that I would be taken, for the certainty that
you would come to visit me in my cell; but it is my desire
to relieve you of everything that might even remind you
of sorrow, and I therefore take leave of you in this letter
with the hope that you will act upon it without delay, and
that no accident will rob you of the reward which your
loyalty merits."</p>

<p>He signed his name without any formal concluding
phrases, and having addressed, stamped and sealed the
envelope, he went out to post it. The dawn was just
breaking, and he could see with sufficient clearness all
about the street and the freight yard in the vicinity of the
hotel. No one, apparently, was stirring save himself. Believing
that Clara would get the letter sooner if he took
it to a post office instead of a street box, he attempted to
find one. He knew there must be a branch office in East
Boston somewhere, but he knew not where to look for it.
He had come to the corner of Maverick Square when he
saw a policeman standing within the shadow of a building.
A violent shudder came over him as he suddenly realized
that he had taken one step toward the officer with a view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
to asking the way to the post office! One of his fits of fear
attacked him and again he staggered, but if the policeman
had any thought of arresting him for drunkenness, he
gave no indication of it, and Litizki stumbled on undisturbed.</p>

<p>When he thought he could do so safely, he turned into
a doorway to recover. He saw a street letter-box within
twenty feet, but as he started toward it, letter in hand,
he heard a bell ringing.</p>

<p>"The ferry!" he muttered, and he began to run toward
the river. With all his fears the little tailor kept his head
faithful to his purpose. It was now in his thoughts that
he would cross the river to the mainland and post his letter
in the general office on Devonshire Street, whence he
knew it would be taken with the least delay to Mr. Pembroke's
house. He was conscious of the risk in thus showing
himself even in the solitary hours of the early morning,
but his courage was returning, and he felt again a
hero who would brave all for her to whom he owed fealty.</p>

<p>The gateman at the ferry heard him running down the
street and held the boat for him. Litizki sank breathless
upon a bench and felt again the triumph of his deed. He
reveled in the difficulties he was overcoming and the dangers
that beset him.</p>

<p>A car was waiting at the city side of the ferry, and Litizki
rode in it as far as Scollay Square. Then he walked
to the post office, and remembering that a stamp window
was open all night, he found it and added to his letter a
"special delivery."</p>

<p>"Now," he muttered, dropping the important missive
in the box, "it doesn't matter what happens to me."</p>

<p>He returned on foot by devious ways to the ferry, more
than once evading marketmen and other early pedestrians
as he felt the recurrence of terror, and at length came
again to his hotel. The employees of the house were astir,
steerage passengers were beginning to arrive, and Litizki
felt a sudden repugnance to the solitude of his chamber.
He sat by a window in the office and watched the groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
of men and women who gradually gathered at the entrance
to the dock, waiting to go on board the Cephalonia
or to bid good-by to friends and relatives.</p>

<p>Before very long he heard the strident voice of a newsboy
calling his morning wares. He listened for a quotation
of startling headlines, expecting that the murder of a
passenger in a drawing-room car would be the great news
feature of the day. Perhaps this boy had not read his
papers carefully. At all events, he shouted nothing whatever
concerning the event that had crowned Litizki's life
and made him a hero and a coward at once.</p>

<p>After some hesitation the tailor bought a paper, and
ran his eyes over the captions of the leading articles. He
found no reference to his deed there. He examined the
paper, column by column, from first page to last, and not
one line set forth so much as a hint of Poubalov's tragic
end.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE GHOST OF POUBALOV.</p>


<p>Litizki laid the newspaper down and tried to reflect.
He had not slept at all since he awoke from a very brief
nap in New York the morning before; therefore, he had
not dreamed the scene in the drawing-room car. With his
own hand he had actually struck Poubalov to the heart,
and his victim had fallen with the gasp and shudder of
death. This was so, and no newspaper could make it otherwise;
but how should it happen that the reporters had
missed the episode?</p>

<p>It had happened upon a railroad train; what more probable,
then, than that the railroad officials had suppressed
the news? He had read many accounts of accidents in
which the reporters set forth the reticence of officials
and employees.</p>

<p>"They imagine," thought Litizki, "that it is not for
their interest to let the public know that so violent a
crime, so they would call it, could be committed in one of
their high-toned cars, and that, moreover, the murderer
could escape."</p>

<p>This thought appeased for a moment the new fear that
threatened to unman him for all time, the fear that he
had failed! Though he openly and emphatically repudiated
all superstitions, and boasted over and again that his
life and views were ruled by reason alone, he was yet subject
to influences that, if they were not superstitions,
were remarkably like them. Among these were his estimate
of Poubalov, whose invincibility seemed to surpass
human powers and attributes. Litizki was conscious of
this tendency to surround the spy with a supernatural atmosphere,
and he struggled against it, the result of his
struggle invariably being his deeper self-abasement as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
recognized Poubalov's immeasurable superiority. Now he
felt again this superhuman character of the spy appealing
to him, setting his poor brain in a whirl, and blurring his
eyes as if a mighty wind had taken up the dust of the
street and held it suspended in a dense cloud before him.</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Litizki, striking his brow angrily,
"he cannot"&mdash;and he stopped suddenly, conscious that he
was speaking aloud. There was nobody in the room but a
sleepy clerk, who looked up curiously from his ledger and
then bent his head again over his work. Litizki tried to
force his thoughts away from the topics that absorbed
him. It occurred to him that he had eaten nothing since
the morning before, and he went to the hotel restaurant.
On the table at which he took a seat was a newspaper left
by some previous customer. It was the same journal that
had beaten its contemporaries in the first publication of
the rumor, that was finally accepted as news, concerning
the elopement of Strobel and Lizzie White. Litizki recalled
the superior enterprise of this paper, and while waiting
for his breakfast, he looked it over. Yes! there it was,
and his heart bounded with joy and fear at once. It was
not a long story under a half-column head, but the few
lines were double-leaded, and paragraphed at every period.
A newspaper man would have seen at a glance that the
item had come in late, after the forms were made up, and
that the editor had "lifted" a story of minor interest to
make room for this. "Probable Murder," was the caption,
and the statement beneath it was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A passenger in one of the drawing-room cars attached to the New
York express due at Park Square at six P.M., but some hours late
last night, was stabbed just before the train reached the station.</p>

<p>"It is believed that the wound was mortal.</p>

<p>"The assailant took advantage of the excitement and confusion to
jump from the train.</p>

<p>"No trace of him has been found.</p>

<p>"The name of the victim is not known at this writing.</p>

<p>"No rumor concerning the tragedy reached this office until long
after midnight.</p>

<p>"The police, to whom the railroad officials secretly reported the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
affair, for reasons best known to themselves, withhold information,
but they admit that the assault took place as described above.</p>

<p>"It is believed that the murderer will be arrested this morning.</p>

<p>"An extra edition giving full details of this occurrence will be published
at ten o'clock."</p></blockquote>

<p>Litizki looked cautiously around the room. A policeman
in full uniform was eating at a table near the door. For
one instant the tailor meditated flight through an open
window. Then he pulled himself together and ate his
breakfast. "We shall see," he thought, and he hastened,
that he might finish ahead of the policeman and pass directly
in front of him on the way to the office.</p>

<p>"If he is here to arrest me," reflected Litizki, "he will
obey his instructions when he sees me go out. If he lets
me alone, it will mean that there is still a chance for
me."</p>

<p>The policeman did not stir when Litizki passed him. The
tailor paid his bill, and, the dock being open, went to the
steamship office and bought a steerage ticket for Liverpool.
He was exultant once more, proud of himself as a
hero.</p>

<p>"The next edition, and then all the papers," he thought,
"will print my name, and everybody will know what I
have done. When Strobel is released there will be plenty
of thinking people who will applaud me in their hearts,
whatever they may say aloud."</p>

<p>Believing that he could sleep now that his mind was
relieved of uncertainty, he went down into the men's department
of the steerage and crawled into a bunk away
forward. A great many passengers were booked for this
trip, and a compartment never used except in the event of
a crowd had been fitted in the very prow of the ship. Litizki
knew that the steward would not assign the bunks
there until none were left elsewhere, and he hoped, therefore,
to be undisturbed until after the boat had started.</p>

<p>So he lay down upon the coarse mattress and tried to
sleep. He closed his eyes only to view again the scene in
the drawing-room car. Physical fatigue caused his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to wander, and he would be conscious that he was dropping
into sleep when suddenly his nerves would seem to
be on fire with life, and he would start violently and grip
the low rail of his bunk as if he were about to fall out. By
dint of will power he compelled himself to remain there,
although as the time passed he was in momentary expectation
of arrest. He began to regret that he had shown himself
so freely. Once the steamer was under way he would
be able to rest undisturbed by phantasies for ten days.
After that, what matter? Those ten days should be passed
in full enjoyment of his one successful act.</p>

<p>As the forenoon dragged along the steerage filled with
men, and there was a constant hum of voices, and the
shuffling of feet as the passengers jostled about in the
narrow quarters and stowed their baggage on and under
their bunks. Several men came into Litizki's compartment
and took possession in turn of the unoccupied places.
Some of them remained, scraping acquaintance with one
another, and passing about the liquor without copious
draughts of which few ocean travelers regard a voyage as
properly begun. In the saloon, champagne serves as the
exhilarant for a scene that should need no wine to set
healthy blood to sparkling; and in the steerage, the whisky
flask accomplishes its purpose just as effectively. A
fellow-passenger offered his flask to Litizki. He was no
drinker, and he accepted the friendly offering more to attract
no comment to himself than because he craved a
stimulant.</p>

<p>Having mumbled "thanks, friend" and drunk as much
as his throat would tolerate of the fiery stuff, he lay down
again. A moment or two later he was surprised to find
that he felt more composed, distinctly drowsy, in fact. He
correctly attributed this to the whisky, and he lay very
still in the hope that natural sleep would at last come
upon him. This might have been the case, but he was
aroused by a rough hand on his foot.</p>

<p>"Come on there, my man; come on," said a commanding
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"You want me, then, do you?" responded Litizki, sitting
up quickly and bumping his head against the deck.</p>

<p>"Save the ship, man," remarked the voice, jocosely,
"and it will be better for your head. That deck's made of
iron. Let me see your ticket."</p>

<p>So it was not a policeman. Litizki showed his ticket,
and the purser's assistant passed on. It must be approaching
the hour of departure. The tailor, fully aroused,
wished that his neighbor would offer him more liquor.</p>

<p>"Do you think," he asked, "that I would have time to
go ashore and get a bottle of whisky?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the facetious reply, "but you wouldn't have
time to get back. Never mind, partner. Have a drop of
this," and again the flask was passed to him.</p>

<p>Litizki did not lie down again immediately after drinking.
He sat crouched over with his hands about his knees,
wondering if Miss Hilman had received his letter. The
men in his compartment were chatting and laughing noisily.
The single port-hole admitted so little light that he
could not have distinguished the features of any of them
except by the closest scrutiny. The steerage steward
looked in.</p>

<p>"There's one place here, sir," he said, "that your man
can have."</p>

<p>"All right," was the reply, in a wheezy, cracked
voice; "take it, Billings."</p>

<p>The tailor started. Was not that the name of the man
whom Miss Hilman had mentioned as the driver of Strobel's
second carriage? Could it be that he was taking
flight, too? or was it a mere coincidence of names?</p>

<p>A young fellow, preceded by an odor of strong drink,
and followed by a decrepit old man, edged into the compartment.
He carried a black, shiny portmanteau which
he threw upon the vacant bunk.</p>

<p>"There!" he growled, "that was heavy. Give me another
swig, Mr. Dexter."</p>

<p>"You shall have it, my boy, and welcome," croaked the
old man, producing a flask from his pocket; "take a good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
long drink. That's it! down with it, he! he! Pleasant
voyage to you, Billings, my boy!"</p>

<p>He patted the young fellow on the shoulder; and Billings,
supposing that his hand was extended to take the
flask, turned his back, and when he had drunk, corked
the flask and remarked thickly:</p>

<p>"I'll keep it thish time."</p>

<p>"All right, all right," responded Dexter; "you may
have it now. I'm going on deck. It's too close here."</p>

<p>He hobbled away, and Billings staggered after him.</p>

<p>Full of wonder, and almost forgetting his own part in
the Strobel matter, Litizki descended from his bunk and
went up to the deck also. To his amazement, he found
that the Cephalonia was already a hundred yards from
the dock. Several conceited little tugs were puffing away
at stem and stern, to turn the gigantic ship about. A
great crowd of people were on the pier, waving hands and
handkerchiefs, and the salutes were frantically returned
by the hundreds on board who crowded close to the rail.</p>

<p>Billings had gone to the rail away from the shore, and
Dexter stood beside him, still talking with forced jocularity,
to which the young man listened with only half comprehension.
The most that his fuddled brain could recognize
was that he was on board a steamer bound for Europe,
a big enough fact in itself to subdue the ordinary
mind.</p>

<p>Litizki watched the pair with troubled curiosity. Could
this be the same Billings? and could his going away portend
any failure for the plan that Litizki had executed at
such heroic self-sacrifice? It could not be possible! The
guilty driver might well flee from punishment, but
neither his presence nor his absence could materially affect
the outcome.</p>

<p>Thinking thus, the tailor allowed his eyes to wander
from Billings and Dexter, taking in the sights of the ship
with indifferent interest. Suddenly he retreated a pace,
and grasped a hatchway to prevent himself from sinking
prone upon the deck. Were all his railings against superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and the supernatural but empty words? Had he
gone stark mad, or was that the ghost of Poubalov leaning
negligently over the rail of the promenade deck and
grinning down at him in evident amusement at his consternation?</p>

<p>A long cry of terror seemed to struggle for utterance in
Litizki's throat, but it found vent in a pitiable whine that
nobody heard above the joyous cheering of the passengers
except his frightened self. He could not take his eyes
from that awful face, whose every feature seemed to glow
with perfect health. How long he stood there, gasping,
powerless under the terrible spell, Litizki could not have
told, but a complete revulsion of feeling overcame him
when the figure on the deck above shrugged its shoulders,
sneered, and strode forward out of sight.</p>

<p>Then Litizki knew that he had failed.</p>

<p>Where now was all the exaltation of heroism that had
sustained him? Where his devotion to Reason, that false
goddess whose dictates had seemed to him infallible?
Even in his agony of humiliation the light broke in upon
him, and he saw that the guiding spirit of his miserable
career had not been abstract, unimpeachable Reason, but a
base, weak imitation&mdash;the lucubration of a disordered intellect,
Litizki's reason.</p>

<p>The unhappy man tried to think, not so much to explain
how it had happened that the dagger had not done
its work, but how should he act now? There was no withdrawal
from the voyage already begun, and he wished
least of all to go ashore. Why had he so insanely thrown
away his revolver? The breast that had resisted a knife
driven by his feeble arm could not withstand the force of
a well-directed bullet.</p>

<p>What should he do? Would fate be once more kind, just
once more, and some time during the coming ten days,
put Poubalov in his way so that he could push the villain
overboard?</p>

<p>Whisky mounted to his brain and told him to hope.
He crawled up the steps to the forecastle-top whence he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
could command a view of the promenade deck throughout
its entire length. Poubalov was there, idly observing the
passing harbor. He hardly stirred until, just after passing
Boston Light, the steamer's engines were stopped, and
with several others, ladies and gentlemen, he went to the
main deck. A tug came alongside, the visitors and the
representatives of the Cunard Company crossed the plank,
and in another moment the great vessel throbbed again
with the revolutions of the screw that, barring accident,
would not cease its work until it had propelled the steamer
to the other side of the world.</p>

<p>Poubalov stood in front of the wheel-house of the tug
and waved his hat to Litizki, and by the side of the spy
stood the decrepit old man, Dexter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE FRONT ROOM.</p>


<p>When Poubalov had fallen to the floor of the car and
Clara was bending over him, his dark eyes shone with savage
luster as he said:</p>

<p>"I am not hurt, Miss Hilman, but I would I were, if I
could thereby gain your sympathy."</p>

<p>"Not hurt!" she repeated aghast at the spectacle he
presented, and unable to credit his words. He lay flat on
his back, and protruding upward from his closely-buttoned
coat was the dagger. It looked as if half the length
of the blade had been buried in his body.</p>

<p>The passengers gathered about, horrified and excited,
while the man whom they supposed to be dying, sat up in
the aisle and deliberately wrenched the blade from his
bosom.</p>

<p>"See," he said holding it aloft where nearly everybody
could observe it, "the point is badly blunted, and I shall
have to grind it down, but there is no blood upon it!"</p>

<p>Then he laughed quietly, sprang to his feet, and with
strong arms helped Clara back to her chair. She was horribly
shocked by the episode, for Litizki's melancholy
meditations rushed back upon her, and she seemed again
to hear him promising yet to do something for her that
should be of great service. And this was it!</p>

<p>She did not then realize that it was a remark of her own
that had inspired his mad brain to action, and it was well
that she did not, for it was enough that she should suffer
as she did, accusing herself of failing to foresee what
would happen if the little tailor were permitted to go on
tormenting himself with the mystery, and indulging his
immeasurable hatred of Poubalov. How could she have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
been so selfish, she thought, as to encourage the unfortunate
man to devote his life to her purpose, and to arouse
such devotion that he was carried by it to the very commission
of murder? She shuddered as the word occurred to
her, and she looked appealingly at Poubalov, as if to seek
from him some further assurance that the miracle had occurred
to avert the tragedy that Litizki had planned.</p>

<p>"It is absolutely nothing, Miss Hilman," said the spy,
interpreting her glance correctly, "save a hole in my coat
and the probable perforation of some interesting documents.
I will show you."</p>

<p>Having just placed her in the chair, he was bending
over her as he spoke, and now he stood erect, and while all
the passengers looked on amazed, he unbuttoned his coat
and drew from the breast pocket a large leather wallet
filled with papers.</p>

<p>"I wear no armor," he said, smiling as he laid the dagger
on the window ledge, that he might use both hands in
showing how he had escaped. One side of the wallet had
the mark of the knife, a gash clean cut in the leather, evidence
sufficient that the blow had fallen with all the force
that Litizki could command. Opening the wallet, he took
out several folded papers, showing without revealing their
nature, that the blade had pierced them. At last he drew
forth a little copper plate, and held it up to the light.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that finished it. The wallet itself was
almost sufficient to save me, but without this plate I think
I should have been scratched a bit. I had this plate engraved
a short time ago in New York, as I wished to present
my card with my name printed in characters that
would be intelligible to English-speaking people. The engraver
gave me the plate, of course, when he delivered
my cards, and at the moment I put it here for convenience.
I had forgotten all about it. You see," handing the
plate to a gentleman who stood beside him, "my friend
managed to erase my name but he left me my life."</p>

<p>"You are to be congratulated," exclaimed the gentleman,
returning the plate after a vain attempt to decipher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the name. The point of the dagger had completely obliterated
several letters and scratched most of the rest.</p>

<p>Clara sat during this with her handkerchief to her lips,
trying to recover her mental poise, and concentrating
her mind on the fact that a tragedy had not taken place.
The train rolled slowly into the station, and the passengers
were speedily occupied with escaping from their confinement.
One officious gentleman remarked to Poubalov:</p>

<p>"You will, of course, report this matter to the police? I
shall be pleased to give you my card if you require a witness,
although I was in the wash-room at the time you
were struck down."</p>

<p>"Thank you," responded Poubalov, with a grave
smile, "I shall not require your card, as I have no complaint
to make."</p>

<p>"What!" blustered the passenger, "you won't have your
assailant arrested? Such a man ought not to be at large."</p>

<p>"The railroad officials may take that view of it if they
choose," said the spy, calmly; "I have no desire in the
matter."</p>

<p>Amazed and indignant, the officious passenger hunted
up an official of the company, and having insisted on a
thorough investigation of the attempted murder, went
home complacent in that he had done his duty as a citizen.
The train-men, of course, reported what they knew of the
occurrence to their chief, but the assailant had leaped
from the train, the name of the victim was not known,
and the result was a lame account of the episode at the
nearest police station late in the evening. The police had
nothing to work upon, and, therefore, said nothing of it to
the reporters when they made their regular calls at the
station; and when at last, very late at night, a reporter to
whose ears an exaggerated rumor had come, telephoned
for corroboration, the sergeant in charge could only say
that something of the kind had occurred; and thus it came
about that one enterprising newspaper had an excusably
imperfect report of the occurrence.</p>

<p>Clara would have left the train without Poubalov's assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
but he took her arm in his, caught up her handbag,
and helped her to the platform, in spite of herself.
Still suffering from the shock, she realized by the close
contact with him how masterful was his influence, and
how by force of character alone he must accomplish quite
as much in his unattractive employment as by intrigue
and deceit.</p>

<p>"I thank you," she said faintly when she stood upon
the platform; "I can go alone quite well now. I cannot
tell you how glad I am that you escaped. I should have
felt guilty if anything serious had happened, and I feel
to blame for what has occurred."</p>

<p>"You mustn't borrow trouble that way, Miss Hilman,"
he responded, gallantly; "the sanest man might well leap
to folly if he imagined that you wished him to."</p>

<p>"It pains me to have you make light of it," said Clara;
"I assure you that I have quite recovered."</p>

<p>"You will permit me to hand you to a carriage, Miss
Hilman? I will not intrude further, believe me."</p>

<p>She nodded assent, and they were about to proceed along
the platform when Poubalov stepped squarely in front of
her.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he said earnestly, "if I do not go as far
even as the carriage. I have not yet had opportunity to
say what I called to tell you about Wednesday evening, or
to explain why I left your house so abruptly and informally.
I shall call to-morrow to complete my errand. I do
not ask your permission to call, as what I would say is important,
and you will want to hear it. This way, cabby!
take care of this lady. Till to-morrow, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>He had moved about slightly as he spoke and now darted
away with quick strides. By standing in front of her and
moving as he did, he had completely concealed from her
view the driver, Billings, who was walking rapidly down
the platform and who passed close by them.</p>

<p>Mystified as usual by his strange conduct, but relieved
that he was gone, Clara followed the cabman and in due
time arrived safely at home. She went to bed at once, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
her cousin enough of what had occurred to show that
she had endured a strain. Louise sat in her room until late
at night, but Clara slept peacefully to all appearances,
and seemed to require no watching. In the early morning
Litizki's letter arrived, and a servant took it to Clara's
room. She read it before dressing.</p>

<p>While it recalled the shudders with which she had
viewed the possibilities of Litizki's crime, and made her
conscientious soul more sensible of what she deemed her
responsibility in the matter, it nevertheless awakened
hope afresh in her heart. Litizki was so positive in his belief
that Ivan was confined in Poubalov's lodging-house,
that she was well nigh convinced by his assurances, crazy
though his brain undoubtedly was; but there were Poubalov's
own utterances on that night when the little tailor
had started to open the door to the hall room. They were
not direct, but was ever Poubalov direct save when telling
a straightforward lie? He had prevented Litizki from
opening that door, and were not his ambiguous words susceptible
of the interpretation that Ivan was, as Litizki
had said, confined there, bound and gagged?</p>

<p>She read and reread again the parts of the letter that
had reference to this clew, and decided that it would be
wrong not to act upon Litizki's suggestions. She was resolved
that nothing she would do should be calculated to
precipitate another tragedy, but rescue her lover she
must, and she set herself to thinking how it could be done.</p>

<p>When she was dressed, she went to her cousin's room,
and Louise was surprised to be awakened by Clara, who
looked none the worse for her extraordinary adventures.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to ask you how you are this morning,"
said Louise, with mock resentment; "I couldn't look as
well as you do if I employed a trained nurse the year
round."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I look better than I feel, dear," responded
Clara; "but I confess that, in spite of everything, I do
feel hopeful. Here is a sad letter from poor Litizki. Read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
it, and tell me if, underneath all his terrible madness,
there is not some ground for hope."</p>

<p>Louise read with awe-struck attention, and laid the long
letter down with a shudder of horror.</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" she exclaimed under her breath, "and
yet with what perfect clearness he expresses himself! No
rambling, few repetitions, everything directly to the point
as he sees it."</p>

<p>"That is the way it impresses me. Litizki was not all
mad. Would it not be madness in us to ignore his information?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it would! what will you do?"</p>

<p>"Do you know Paul Palovna's address?"</p>

<p>"No, but Ralph would."</p>

<p>"I shall write a note to Paul. Get right up, please, and
write to Ralph, telling him to see that my note reaches
Paul as soon as possible. Of course, we cannot follow poor
Litizki's plan, for he believed that he had killed Poubalov.
How he must suffer! But we can investigate his theory,
at all events, in our own way."</p>

<p>The letters they wrote were taken to Ralph Harmon by
a servant, and shortly before noon Paul appeared at Mr.
Pembroke's house, in answer to Clara's summons. Her
uncle had returned to Boston as he had planned, but he
had sent word that he should not be able to come home
until some time in the evening. So, again, Clara was
thrown upon her own resources for guidance and action.</p>

<p>Clara went over the whole situation with Paul, who expressed
his regret that she had not sooner called upon him
for assistance.</p>

<p>"Not," he said, "that I could have done anything better
than you have, but that I should have liked to help."</p>

<p>"Events have happened too rapidly," she replied, "to
make it possible for me to think of more than each episode
as it occurred. I don't want you to take a step in this if it
is to be at the cost of the slightest danger to yourself."</p>

<p>"There is no danger," said Paul; "I do not underrate
Poubalov's capacity for evil, but he has no reason to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
against me. I doubt if he would recognize me, though he
probably knows my name as that of Strobel's most intimate
friend. As I understand it, you wish me to make a
thorough investigation of Poubalov's house."</p>

<p>"Yes, it should have been done days ago, and I would
have seen to it had Litizki told me of his experience
there."</p>

<p>"It will be very simple. I will go there to look for
rooms. Even if he should be there, and see me, he cannot
well prevent me from going through the house. I will report
to you before the day is over."</p>

<p>Clara had not shown Litizki's letter to Paul, but she told
him enough about it and its contents to convince him that
the tailor had been on the right track. He was in feverish
haste to get downtown and effect a solution of the mystery
at once, and he more than half believed that he
should succeed.</p>

<p>His hope that Poubalov would not be in at the time of
his call was realized, of course, for the spy was at that
time on his way up the harbor after bidding the Cephalonia
bon voyage. A scrubwoman answered his ring at 32
Bulfinch Place and left him standing in the hall while she
went for the landlady.</p>

<p>Paul had observed that the window just over the door
was concealed by the blinds, whereas every other window
on the front of the house was fully exposed.</p>

<p>"I have several rooms vacant," said the landlady as she
came jingling a bunch of keys from a back room. She was
a stout, good-humored-looking woman whose pleasant
face, a little hardened by business dealings, perhaps, did
not suggest the duplicity that would be essential to an alliance
with such a man as Poubalov. "What kind of a
room do you want?"</p>

<p>Paul thought he would look at them all.</p>

<p>"I don't mind the price so much," he said, "as the way
the room strikes me."</p>

<p>"Well," responded the landlady with a sigh, "if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
want a five-dollar room, I'd like to save climbing stairs to
show those at two dollars. Come on."</p>

<p>"There's a room for five," she said, opening the door of
the back room up one flight. It was the room adjoining
that occupied by Poubalov. "The others on this floor are
occupied."</p>

<p>"This little front room, too?" asked Paul, his hand on
the door. He had quietly tried it and found it locked before
she answered in the affirmative and started up the
next flight.</p>

<p>They looked at every room in the house above the second
floor. Some of them were occupied, but the landlady
opened the doors and looked in. Paul noticed that the only
locked door was the one to the front hall room next to
Poubalov's.</p>

<p>"Well," said the landlady at last as they stood on the
landing beside Poubalov's door, "do you see anything you
like?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Paul, "I'll take this back room," and
he took a five-dollar bill from his pocket and gave it to
her. He said he would occupy the room at once, and the
landlady gave him a house key.</p>

<p>While this transaction was in progress, a young woman
came up the stairs, humming a tune with that nonchalance
that indicates familiarity with one's surroundings,
opened the door of the little front room with a key she
took from her purse, and went in, leaving the door open
until she had thrown back the blinds.</p>

<p>"She's been with me a year and a half," remarked the
landlady, complacently, "and I don't believe you could
hire her to occupy any other room."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">WHAT PAUL PALOVNA SAW.</p>


<p>Paul was not disheartened by his discovery, or by the
landlady's comment. He believed that she was telling the
truth, and that the door that Litizki supposed to communicate
with the little front room really opened into a huge
closet, a convenience with which the old-fashioned house
abounded. He had paid a week's rent, and he determined
to get some good out of it. Accordingly, he returned to
his regular quarters, and packed a bag with personal effects,
as if he were going upon a journey. This he took
down to the room in Bulfinch Place. He saw the landlady
again as he entered.</p>

<p>"By the way," he said, "is there any communication
between my room and the one in front?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied; "there's a door there that was put in
years ago when a family occupied the whole of that floor,
but it is nailed up. It won't open from either side, so you
needn't be afraid. There's a very quiet gentleman in the
front room, so you won't be disturbed."</p>

<p>"All right, thanks," responded Paul, thinking that in
due time he might make good use of the landlady's proclivity
for gossip. He went to his room and studied the
disused door attentively. There was a keyhole, but it
was securely plugged. He lay upon the floor and peered
under, but the door came close down upon the threshold,
and nothing was to be seen.</p>

<p>"It's a disagreeable expedient," he muttered, "but the
end justifies the means in this case. I won't say anything
to Miss Hilman about it, though."</p>

<p>He opened his bag and took out a gimlet that he had
bought on the way to his permanent room. Then he drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a chair to the door, stood upon it, and began to bore, starting
at a level with his eyes, and slanting slightly downward.
His notion was that Poubalov would not be so
likely to observe the tiny hole if it were a foot or two
above his head as if it were lower. For the same reason
he bored very close to the edge of a panel, and he took
great care not to let the gimlet more than pierce the
further side of the wood. It would never do to let any
fresh dust show on the carpet in Poubalov's room.</p>

<p>After frequent experiments, to observe how far he had
penetrated, he found that he could faintly discern the
light from Poubalov's windows when he placed his eye
close to the door and shaded it with his hands. Then he
took a rusty nail that he pulled from the wall of his
closet, and, working it patiently with his fingers, pushed it
through the partially-bored hole until half its length must
have protruded into the other room. A little more effort
and he could put the nail in place and withdraw it without
the slightest noise. Among the trifles that had accumulated
in his possessions was an untrained lithograph representing
cupids throwing flowers as big as themselves
at one another. He could hardly remember how he came
to have it; some young lady sent it to him, probably, as
long ago as last Valentine's Day; but there it was, with a
neat little card attached; and he hung it on the nail to excuse
his operation should the landlady happen to notice
it. There were plenty of hooks in the room, but he would
tell her that it was his fancy to embellish the door.</p>

<p>"There," he thought, as he contemplated his finished
work, "if our spy is not more observing and suspicious
than I think he is, I shall be able to take a look at him occasionally."</p>

<p>Having carefully cleaned up the slight litter he had
made, he locked the door of his room and went to make
his report to Clara.</p>

<p>He told her frankly that he believed Litizki had been
mistaken about the little front room. "But," he added, "I
have taken the back room for a week, and I shall be surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
if I do not make some discovery before my time is
up."</p>

<p>Intent upon being on the ground, where he could watch
every movement of Poubalov, he hurried back to Bulfinch
Place, and sat himself down to pass time with books until
the spy should come in.</p>

<p>All day long Clara heeded her uncle's injunction to rest,
but that was because there was nothing she could do.
Moreover, she expected Poubalov, and she was more than
anxious to be at home to receive him. He came about five
o'clock. The young ladies were refreshing themselves
with tea, and Louise, who never ceased to be amazed at
her cousin's proceedings, almost gasped when she saw
Clara greet him cordially and hasten to get a cup for him.</p>

<p>One would not have expected Poubalov to show fatigue,
if he ever felt it, but if he were not weary on this occasion,
something had occurred to disturb him. His eyes
were heavy, his accent harder to understand than usual,
and it was not until several minutes had passed, and he
had drank freely of tea, that he spoke with anything like
his customary masterful confidence. Clara led the conversation
at the start. After the first greetings she referred to
the episode in the car, saying:</p>

<p>"I should have thought you would suffer as I did from
the shock of that terrible assault. It was dreadful to look
at, and how much more dreadful to be the intended victim."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Miss Hilman," responded the spy;
"the very shock of the blow convinced me that I was unharmed.
There was therefore no more occasion for alarm
on my part than as if a book had fallen from the rack
upon my head."</p>

<p>"But, really, I supposed the worst had happened," insisted
Clara, "for you not only fell but you gasped&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naturally. To put it roughly, the fellow knocked the
breath out of me."</p>

<p>"And have you heard nothing of Litizki?"</p>

<p>Poubalov looked at her gravely as he answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have seen him."</p>

<p>"Seen him!" echoed both his listeners, and "where?"
asked Clara.</p>

<p>"He was not under arrest," answered Poubalov; "he
was free, as free as he ever will be with the memory of
the recent past to haunt him, as it certainly will. You
will never see him again"&mdash;he raised his hand deprecatingly;
"pardon me, I did not mean to suggest the slightest
discomfort. He has not committed suicide, and I do
not know that he contemplates it."</p>

<p>He turned his attention to his tea, and both young ladies
were silent for a moment. Then Louise found an excuse
for withdrawing, and Clara was left alone with the
inscrutable foe to her happiness. There was a marked
pause after Louise had gone, Clara waiting for Poubalov,
and the spy&mdash;who can tell what was coursing through his
mind? At length he set down his cup, and with an attempt
at the aggressive self-possession that usually characterized
his demeanor, he said:</p>

<p>"I owe you an explanation, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>"Only one?" she asked coldly, but there was a strange
smile on her face.</p>

<p>"Many," responded the spy, and there was an expression
on his features, in his bearing, in the tones of his
voice, that, but for the circumstances, might have been
credited to sincerity. He was either not his usual self, or
he was playing a much deeper game than any he had yet
revealed. "Many," he repeated, "and they will all be
made in due time. Do you see that I honor you in the
highest way that is possible for me? I mean by not treating
you to the customary forms of courtesy which are the
more or less transparent garments of falsehood. I do not
come here with a plausible story to account for my conduct,
asking you to accept it as an apology whether you
believe it, or not. I tell you the truth, so far as I speak at
all; and when the nature of the case would compel me to
lie if I opened my lips, I am silent."</p>

<p>"Or you evade the question," interposed Clara, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
again she smiled provokingly, but there was no invitation
to feel at ease in her expression. Poubalov did not misinterpret
it, and it almost seemed as if he, the master
mind, were discomposed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do," he admitted after a moment; "my
habits of speech are not such as conduce to absolute candor
even with you, whom I respect too highly to consciously
deceive. Tell me, Miss Hilman, will you not, can you not
believe that I tell you the truth?"</p>

<p>"I have thought about it a great deal," replied Clara
steadily, "and sometimes I almost think you do; but, you
know, you have really had very little conversation with
me."</p>

<p>"True enough, and I must confess that I never found
it so hard to take my part in a conversation as I do at
this minute. I usually lead it, I may say dominate it,"
and he smiled a little; "usually, you see, I make people,
men and women, believe me. I would beg you to, Miss
Hilman, if only I knew how."</p>

<p>"Why try to compel me to stand on the same plane as
you do?" asked Clara; "you confess your habits of deceit.
How can I promise to believe you without confessing that,
for this moment at least, I accept your own style of intercourse?"</p>

<p>"You are an invincible logician, Miss Hilman," exclaimed
Poubalov, compressing his lips. "I give up, and
will let my words stand or fall on their merits, according
as you judge them. I came here on Wednesday evening to
tell you some things I had discovered. The man Billings
called before I had begun to speak. I departed unceremoniously,
because I did not wish to meet him."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Clara, simply. "I knew it at the
time."</p>

<p>"Of course you did," responded Poubalov, crestfallen;
"you could not infer otherwise, and my confession has all
the appearance, therefore, of a pitiably weak attempt to
bolster up my claim to veracity."</p>

<p>"I do not interpret it that way. I can make my own test<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of your veracity. I shall listen to whatever you have to
say, without reference to what you call a confession."</p>

<p>"Well, then," resumed the spy, speaking rapidly, "this
is what I came to say. I had made investigations in my
own way along the lines of the theory laid down with respect
to the possible operations of Nihilists against Mr.
Strobel. I caught Litizki shadowing me, and recognized
him as one with whom I had come in official contact in
Russia. It seemed to me child's play to deal with him,
for I had no respect for his intellect. I supposed at first
that he was tracking me as the agent of a Nihilistic society.
Then I learned that he was devoted to Strobel. I
knew he would come to see me, but not openly. So I sat
up for him, and he crept into the house like a thief. We
had a conversation that I will not pause to detail. I did my
best to impress him with my power, and then let him go
away, for I wanted him to be at large, and I did not want
him just then to report to you what I had told him. You
see, I purposely allowed him to nurse his suspicions of
me. Next day I called at his shop, my sole purpose being
to learn who his associates were, and to endeavor to fasten
upon them the taking off of Strobel. Among the men in
his shop was one Boris Vargovitch, at one time somewhat
of a leader among the Nihilists. The rest that I was going
to say on that evening I do not need to say now, for I have
since become convinced that Litizki was acting irresponsibly
in pursuing me, and that if Nihilists were active, he
was not in their confidence. Furthermore, I am now convinced
that neither Vargovitch nor any other former Nihilist
in Boston was concerned in the Strobel matter. I
was mistaken in supposing that the Nihilists continued
their close organization in this country. They may send
revolutionary literature to Russia, but they do not keep
up active operations here. I withdraw my innuendoes
against them, therefore, and have to confess that you are
now just as far along in your painful search as you were
five days ago."</p>

<p>Clara was deeply impressed by this narration. She could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
see no flaw in it, no evidence of untruthfulness. But there
was a touch of evasion in the conclusion, and she remarked
with merciless coolness:</p>

<p>"You do not say that we are as far along as five days
ago. You confine the lack of progress to me."</p>

<p>There was a hasty glance from the spy that looked like
apprehension.</p>

<p>"Of course, I catch the significance of your words," he
said; "you think I know more than I tell, that I instigated
the abduction of Strobel."</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, looking straight into his eyes,
"why did you not wish to meet Billings?"</p>

<p>He hesitated, and the color rose slowly to his cheeks.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "not now. I have said all I can for
the present. I am still pursuing this matter, Miss Hilman,
but I must put off further information. I would ask you
to trust me to report faithfully to you but that it is such a
farce for two persons like you and me to bandy words."</p>

<p>"It is a cruel farce," she exclaimed, rising indignantly;
"you pretend to help me and you laboriously tell me
things I already know."</p>

<p>She walked across the room, and her brain struggled for
a plan in the confusion of impulses, hopes and fears. What
might Paul accomplish? Would she not surely lose a possible
point by dismissing the spy once and for all, and
might she not some day gain much by keeping in some sort
of communication with him? This was the policy she had
determined upon, and she would adhere to it. So she
turned and faced him. He had risen, waiting her word of
dismissal or encouragement.</p>

<p>"I will give you one more opportunity to tell me the
whole truth and make amends," she said sternly; "I believe
what you have told me to-night. Next time I must
have all, and nothing short of it. Will you come to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Hilman, in the evening."</p>

<p>He bowed gravely and left the house.</p>

<p>Paul did not venture to go to dinner when evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
came. He read on and on, waiting to hear Poubalov enter
the adjoining room. It was late in the evening when at
last he heard the door open and close, and he knew that
the spy was at home.</p>

<p>Then Paul laid down his book and stepped cautiously
upon the chair by the door. He carefully drew out the
nail and applied his eye to the hole. He commanded a
view of the very center of Poubalov's room.</p>

<p>The spy had thrown himself into a chair, and was sitting
as if deeply wrapped in thought. There were wrinkles
in his brow and his lips were set close together.</p>

<p>After a few moments thus, he took his traveling bag
from the bureau and unlocked it. Having fumbled over
the contents, he drew forth a cabinet photograph that he
took directly under the chandelier where the light was
strongest. His back was partially turned to Paul, and he
held the card so that the observer at the nail hole could
see it distinctly.</p>

<p>With a shock of surprise Paul recognized it as a picture
of Clara Hilman.</p>

<p>Poubalov gazed long and earnestly at it and then
touched it reverently to his lips.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">POUBALOV'S REVOLUTION.</p>


<p>Paul's heart seemed to stand still as he reflected on Poubalov's
act. The original purpose of the spy in calling upon
Strobel and instigating his abduction, was as much a mystery
as ever, but it was one that could be explained on the
ground of Poubalov's confessed relations with the government
with which Strobel had been in conflict. There
was nothing personal in that; but here was an element of
personal relationship that might lead to worse than complications.</p>

<p>Poubalov in love&mdash;no! not that sacred word; infatuated,
rather, with Clara Hilman.</p>

<p>What hope could there now be that the spy, having
some day accomplished the purpose for which he had
crossed the ocean to find Strobel, would set him free? In
the very hopelessness of his passion would he not first
murder Strobel, and then Clara herself? Paul felt sick
with horror as the possibility of these tragedies occurred
to his mind. They were more than possible. With Poubalov's
character in view, they seemed like certainties.
What could be done to avert them? What would Clara
say? How revolting, more than terrifying, would be the
revelation that this subtle, conscienceless foe had dared to
love her!</p>

<p>At first blush Paul felt that he could not tell Clara what
he had seen. If there were only something that he himself
could do to solve the mystery of Ivan's disappearance, for
only Strobel's presence in perfect health could serve to
check the spy's villainous course. He held absolute command
of the situation as long as he succeeded in keeping
Strobel in hiding. As the sense of his helplessness grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
upon him, like an insidious vine whose twining tendrils
choke the growth of a sapling, Paul wondered that poor
Litizki's devotion had not the sooner driven him to madness.</p>

<p>He saw that, with all its evils, the situation must be
made clear to Clara. He would continue his observations
during the next forenoon, and then report to her.</p>

<p>Poubalov had said that he would call in the evening;
Clara, therefore, in the early afternoon went to see Mrs.
White. She went with no purpose of accomplishing anything
in the mystery, but rather as an act of kindness to
report how she had found Lizzie; but as she was about to
turn into Ashburton Place, she saw Paul at the foot of
the hill and she waited for him to come up. He had just
started for Roxbury.</p>

<p>"I have something to tell," he said in answer to her
anxious look of inquiry, "but I fear it is nothing that will
be helpful, and it will certainly be disagreeable."</p>

<p>"I was going to call on Mrs. White," responded Clara;
"suppose you go with me; but you can tell me what you
have discovered before we go in."</p>

<p>"If you think best," and Paul hesitated.</p>

<p>"I do. Have no fear of me. Have I not learned to endure
anything that can happen?"</p>

<p>"Poubalov loves you, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>Clara blushed very faintly, looked straight into Paul's
eyes for an instant, then off at the house-tops, and answered:</p>

<p>"I felt it. How did you find out?"</p>

<p>Amazed and relieved, Paul told her.</p>

<p>"I have made myself a spy," he concluded, "but I felt
that the circumstances justified me."</p>

<p>"So I think, too," rejoined Clara. "Well, let us go on. I
don't know at this moment how to act, but I cannot help
thinking that this will bring matters to a crisis, and I
hope, in spite of reason and fears, that it will end happily.
I wonder where Poubalov got my photograph."</p>

<p>Then she remembered that when the reporter, Shaughnessey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
had returned her photograph, it had been placed
for the moment upon the mantel in the drawing-room.
The next day she had looked for it, and, not finding it at
once, had supposed that Louise or a servant had put it
away. In the stress of events she had thought no more
about it; but Poubalov's call and bareheaded flight had
occurred after the return of the photograph, and the natural
and satisfactory explanation, therefore, was that he
had stolen it.</p>

<p>"There is one more thing," added Paul as they walked
along, "and I suppose it shows that in order to circumvent
this man one must have sleepless eyes and untiring vigilance.
As soon as Poubalov went to bed last night, I hurried
out and got supper. It didn't take me long, for I was
anxious to get to sleep, so that I might get up early
enough this morning to keep track of him. I rose before
six, and took a preliminary peep through my nail hole.
Poubalov had gone, and up to just now, when I left, had
not returned."</p>

<p>"I think there is nothing lost," said Clara; "he is to call
on me this evening, and your discovery makes it certain
that he will come. If you will come out to the house ahead
of him, I should like it ever so much if you would follow
him when he goes away."</p>

<p>They were at Mrs. White's door, and Paul preferred
not to go in. There was nothing more to be said, and it
seemed better that he should return to Bulfinch Place, to
observe Poubalov's doings, should he return.</p>

<p>Mrs. White, comparatively free from anxiety about her
daughter, seemed more than desirous of talking about
Mr. Strobel.</p>

<p>"I had a letter from Lizzie last night," she said, "and
she told me how kind you were. I'm real glad you went
to see her, 'cause it must make you feel so much more satisfied
to know that Mr. Strobel did not run away with her.
And you know, Miss Hilman, I can't quite think that the
dark gentleman, Mr. Pou&mdash;something, has anything to
do with it. He seems such a perfect gentleman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is very hard to understand it all," responded Clara;
"but what makes you think Poubalov is better than we
have thought him?"</p>

<p>"Two or three things. Lizzie wrote me that he called to
see her just after you had gone away, and she says he
seemed real earnest about trying to find Mr. Strobel, and
was just as polite as could be."</p>

<p>"Doesn't she say anything more about his call than
that?"</p>

<p>"No, except that he spoke very kindly, and didn't let
her think that he had suspected her of anything wrong."</p>

<p>"I should say not," remarked Clara, rather bitterly;
"no one would know better than he that Lizzie was not
concerned in the affair."</p>

<p>"I don't see why, Miss Hilman. Why shouldn't he think
what other people thought? I'm afraid he did, for last
Thursday evening he called here, and we had a real good
talk about it. He seemed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you tell him I had gone to New York?" interrupted
Clara, sharply, for she was impatient with these
ingenuous statements of what Poubalov seemed to be.</p>

<p>"Land sakes, no!" replied Mrs. White, "but he told me
he was going on, and when he suggested so kindly that he
would look up Lizzie, and let me know how she was situated,
I was glad to give him her address. He hasn't been
here since, though. Perhaps he hasn't got back yet."</p>

<p>Clara wondered wearily how stupidity should manage to
flourish in a world where people have to struggle so hard
against one another, and then she immediately reproached
herself for the thought, recalling what a taxing puzzle
Poubalov's character presented to herself. She made no
effort to undeceive Mrs. White&mdash;how could she with so
little as she herself actually knew?&mdash;but rather turned the
conversation into simple channels until she took her departure.</p>

<p>Paul arrived at Mr. Pembroke's about six o'clock, reporting
that Poubalov had been absent all day until late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
in the afternoon, and that when he came in he immediately
began preparations for going out again.</p>

<p>"I came along at once," said Paul, "lest he should get
here ahead of me."</p>

<p>Clara asked her uncle if he would like to meet the spy.</p>

<p>"No," he answered uneasily; "what good purpose
would it serve?"</p>

<p>"I thought that perhaps you might read him better
than I can," said Clara; "I don't see how we can help
coming to a crisis this evening, and if you could help,
we might bring about the release of Ivan all the sooner."</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke was careworn, and all his utterances and
actions had been marked by indecision since his return
from New York.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can do no good," he said with a sigh;
"handle the situation as best you can, Clara. I believe
you will find your happiness restored to you shortly."</p>

<p>With that he shut himself in his library, and they saw
no more of him that night.</p>

<p>Poubalov acted more like himself than he did the day
before, but it was apparent to Clara that his confident
self-possession was maintained by an effort.</p>

<p>"Must we begin where we left off yesterday?" he said
by way of introduction.</p>

<p>"You may begin where you please," responded Clara,
"but you must tell me the truth. I think you are going
to do so, Mr. Poubalov."</p>

<p>"I cannot remember that I have told you a single lie
since I met you, Miss Hilman. It must be a strange admission
for you to hear me make, that I am not certain when
I have spoken truly and when falsely; but that is the
fault of the peculiar work that my emperor has set me to
do, and it is not due in the present instance to any purpose
of deceiving you. I am going to begin by telling you
of a discovery that I have made since I began to work on
this case&mdash;a discovery that to me, at least, is startling.</p>

<p>"My experience throughout all my life has been such as
to make me believe that honesty and sincerity did not exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
save in the characters of simple-minded people whom
it would be too harsh to call fools, and yet who are
nothing short of fools when you look at them from the
point of view of self-interest and material advancement.
What have I found to be the chief requisite of leadership,
whether in guiding the state, or seeking to wreck it, or in
commerce? Craft, Miss Hilman, craft that suggests and
includes indirect methods to attain ends, the holding out
of false hopes, the display of the gilded side of things, the
concealment of the base material&mdash;in short, trickery,
which is but another name for treachery. I have believed
that keen minds saw the folly of what we call honesty,
and to find candor in a person of intelligence would have
seemed to me an anomaly. I have discovered that extraordinary
combination, Miss Hilman, and have been stupefied
to find that my methods, however subtle, have availed
nothing in opposition to this unaffected, unconscious honesty.
It is a revelation to my mind that threatens to effect
a revolution in my convictions."</p>

<p>"One moment, Mr. Poubalov," interrupted Clara; "your
habit of circuitous approach to a point is still strong upon
you, and according to your own admissions, it is out of
place in conversation with me. Permit me, then, to help
you adjust yourself to your incomplete revolution, and I
will do so without any clever turns of phraseology. I am,
then, the embodiment of this wonderful candor that you
have discovered. It would have taken you a long time to
say it. I appreciate the compliment. Go on, please."</p>

<p>There was a suspicion of a tremor in Poubalov's voice
as he continued:</p>

<p>"Yes, you have said it, beating me, as usual, in the one
part wherein I thought I was skilled. But I have to add,
Miss Hilman, that having discovered the existence of honesty
associated with the highest order of intelligence, I
am astounded to find that I not only do not scorn and despise
it, I admire it&mdash;more than that, I am conquered by
it; I yield to it as a serf to the will of his master, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
worship her who&mdash;" his voice railed him for an instant
and then he concluded, "you, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>Clara sat looking calmly at the spy, much as if she were
regarding a play in which he was an actor, or, as it seemed
to him, as if she were studying a strange anatomical specimen.</p>

<p>"This must be a remarkable experience for you," she
said simply.</p>

<p>"It is a marvel!" he responded with great emphasis;
"I, who knew only loyalty to my czar, find that there is
something more potent to stir me than his beck, or his reward.
I love, and with all the strength of my being!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem at all strange to me," she murmured,
her voice low and musical; "I have never rated you as
less than a human being, though at times you have seemed
to fall infinitely below the standard of such men as it has
been my good fortune to know."</p>

<p>Poubalov winced at this merciless thrust at his intense
egotism, and Clara went on:</p>

<p>"What I do not understand is why you should have been
to the mortifying pains of telling me about it, for it is a
farce for such persons as you and me to bandy words. Has
your revolution so far progressed as to convince you that
it is worth while to waste energy?"</p>

<p>"A man must speak out when he loves as I do," said
Poubalov, desperately. "I will not rave, as I have read
that lovers do; I will stick to my logic; but I must confess
that when I awakened to this emotion, I could not
help a day dream in which I saw you by my side, and the
sight was sweet, it was inspiring, for it cannot be often
that minds of such caliber as ours are brought together
and united for life."</p>

<p>"It will be better to return to your logic, Mr. Poubalov,"
said Clara, gently; his tones were passionate in spite
of his evident effort, and she had no desire to lead him
on to a freer outburst. "Let us dismiss this experience of
yours, in which, of course, I share only as a disinterested
spectator. What have you done with the man I do love?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Poubalov rose, and Clara expected to see him pace up
and down the room after the manner of her uncle when
he was agitated; but the spy stood before her trembling
in every limb.</p>

<p>"You have asked me the wrong question, Miss Hilman,"
he said hoarsely, "and I shall not answer it."</p>

<p>"Then," exclaimed Clara, "either leave me at once, or
proceed in your own way to tell me what I wish to know.
I have been days in my search, and I can listen to you
for the whole of this evening if it is necessary in order to
learn what I must know."</p>

<p>"Suppose I should tell you," said Poubalov, slowly,
"that I can lay my hands upon Strobel at any moment.
What would you say?"</p>

<p>"I should bid you to bring him to me."</p>

<p>Poubalov shook his head.</p>

<p>"I should not do it," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">AT ONE O'CLOCK A.M.</p>


<p>Clara rose at this and faced her adversary, speaking
with intensity no less than his:</p>

<p>"It discredits your boasted intelligence," she said, "to
presume so much as to suggest a compromise to me. There
can be no middle course. You do not care that I consider
you an unspeakable villain, but you must see that you are
bound to do one thing or the other. Bring my lover to
me, or&mdash;it would be idle boasting to say what the alternative
would be, but you know that I should never cease to
pursue you. In my own way I should certainly circumvent
you some day."</p>

<p>"Yes, you would, I believe that; but, Miss Hilman, I
decline to accept your first alternative," and he strode
toward the door.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she cried, running forward and getting in his
way. "I told you this would be your last opportunity to
tell me the whole truth. You haven't told me anything
yet that I want to know. I meant what I said. I will not
have you come here again."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, we shall meet again, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>Poubalov now appeared imperturbable. He had confessed
to a certain weakness and defeat; in the presence of
excitement and insistence he was easily the master of
himself and the situation.</p>

<p>Clara realized quickly that she had lost a point by
yielding even momentarily to her emotions, and she
strove to recover by assuming once more what Poubalov
called her logical position.</p>

<p>"You have said that you love me," she said as calmly as
possible; "can you ask me to believe that when you deliberately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
cause me the most cruel grief? Is that consistent?
With all your confessed craft, you have a certain half-respectable
consistency, for you confess to me at least, how
base you are. Will you, then, love and torture me, too?"</p>

<p>The spy became deathly pale for an instant, and then
answered:</p>

<p>"We shall see. I have made my confession, and nothing
now shall swerve me from accomplishing my purpose in
my own way."</p>

<p>"Is there such a thing as love of fair play in you?"
asked Clara, her emotions now quelled and every instinct
alive once more to fencing with her adversary.</p>

<p>"I suppose not, except in an argument. Even then it
might not seem to be fair play to the party who found
himself overmatched."</p>

<p>"In your arguments with me you do not treat me with
the ordinary fairness of admitting me to a common
ground with you. You withhold facts without which I
cannot argue as well as I might."</p>

<p>"That, Miss Hilman, is because our contest is over a real
issue, not over an abstraction."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder that poor Litizki regarded you as a
fiend!"</p>

<p>"Therein you manifest yourself a woman. You long for
invective, but your refinement cannot teach you how to
use epithets effectively."</p>

<p>"This is the end of talking," said Clara, moving away;
"I will not detain you."</p>

<p>Poubalov promptly bowed ceremoniously, bade her
good-evening, and left the house.</p>

<p>Paul slipped out after him, and tried his ability at
playing "shadow."</p>

<p>Clara was greatly disturbed by her interview with Poubalov,
although it had added nothing to her knowledge of
the circumstances with which she was blindly battling.
She felt like retiring at once, for she was exhausted, but
there was a fresh call upon her strength within a few
minutes of the spy's departure. This time it was the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
whom she knew only by his first name, "Mike," who had
been sent from the livery stable to take Ivan to the wedding.
He was an uncouth, illiterate young man, the most
violent contrast imaginable to her recent visitor, but also
the most welcome, for there could be no manner of doubt
as to his simple honesty. Clara found it a relief to talk
with him apart from the fact that his message was one
that stirred her with new hope and stimulated her weary
brain to new plans for Ivan's deliverance.</p>

<p>"I was to say to ye," said Mike, "how I'd had me eyes
an' more, too, last night, on the feller what did the trick
to me wheel."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed Clara eagerly; "but what do
you mean? Did somebody send you to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm, me boss. I told me boss about it, an' he says
you go to Miss Hilman with that, an' tell her all about it,
an', says he, if it's anything that can be useful to her you
can do, do it, says he."</p>

<p>"You must thank him for me," said Clara. "Now tell
me, please, how and where you saw this man, and what
he said. I won't interrupt you."</p>

<p>"It's not me as would like to tell you what he said,
miss. He wasn't speakin' to a lady, an' I'm thinkin' a lady
wouldn't 'a' give him the cause to curse as I did."</p>

<p>Mike grinned in enjoyment of some retrospect that Clara
thought she could imagine, and she smiled and waited patiently
for him to tell his story in his own way.</p>

<p>"It was last evenin', miss, at the corner of Dover an'
Washington streets. I was done with me work for the
day, an' was standin' in a saloon by the bar, havin' a drop
of beer by myself, when this loafer came in. He stood
alongside o' me an' called for something, I don't mind
now what, for I was onto him, an' was thinkin' to meself
would I thump him, or would I have an argyment. I was
lookin' straight at him, me hand on me beer glass, an' I
suppose he noticed me for that, for pretty soon he turns
around an' with a kind of a start, 'Hello!' says he.</p>

<p>"Now I don't know what would 'a' happened if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
hadn't spoke, for I would 'a' spoke to him, an' it might
'a' been all the same, but I was that mad all of a sudden,
that I let the beer fly in his face. With that he jumped on
me an' we had a fine fight, till the bartenders came round
an' chucked us both into the street. They was a policeman
near by, so we quit fightin', an' went to another bar
where we had a drink an' got friendly. He was already
pretty full, miss, an' I was as sober as I am now, an' after
three or four more drinks he got to talkin' confidential
about that wheel."</p>

<p>Clara was on the qui vive with anxiety to know just
what had occurred between Mike and his acquaintance,
while at the same time she felt repugnance to basing any
serious efforts upon the words of a drunken man, as well
as distrust as to the value of a clew from such a source;
but she felt, too, that she could stop at nothing in the
emergency that confronted her. So she asked, "What did
he say, Michael?"</p>

<p>"First off he was for denyin' that he had anythin' to do
with it; but bymeby, seein' as I wasn't mad any more, an'
enjoyin' the trick of it himself, he told me he done it, an'
I know what became of your man,' says he. 'An' what?'
says I. With that, though, he shut up. He winked his eye,
an' talked about somethin' else, an' I, not thinkin' or
caring very much at the time, didn't ask many questions.
But this mornin' I was thinkin' it over, an' wonderin'
what became of th' gentleman, an' thinkin' there must
be something crooked, or they wouldn't 'a' took me wheel
off, an' so I told me boss an' he told me to tell you."</p>

<p>"It was very kind of you both," said Clara grateful, yet
fearful that the point of most importance had been lost.</p>

<p>"Was his name Billings?"</p>

<p>"No'm, 'twas Patterson. Him an' me was together for
some time after the fight, an' I walked along home with
him."</p>

<p>"You know where he lives then?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, miss, but I could go pretty near to it.
You see, we was goin' along Washington Street toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Roxbury, and had come a long way from Dover, when
he turns down a side street, an' then another, an' I kep'
along for I hadn't anything better to do. He'd been silent
for a while, an' suddenly he stops an' says, tryin' hard to
brace up. 'You mustn't come any further,' says he. 'Why
not?' says I, half minded to give him another lickin', only
he was too full. ''Cause me boss says he will&mdash;&mdash;' but
never mind what he said his boss would do. I said I didn't
care, an' turned back. He went on, an' then I was minded
to see where he went. Of course it was dark, an' I couldn't
be certain, but I think I could go straight to that building."</p>

<p>"Will you take me there?" asked Clara.</p>

<p>"Now, miss?"</p>

<p>Clara reflected. Other objections aside, it might be the
worst possible policy to move prematurely in the matter.
It might be a false clew, she knew nothing about the
building, and meantime Paul was following Poubalov.
Much as she longed for immediate action, it seemed wiser
to postpone it until an investigation could be made.</p>

<p>"Would your employer spare you to help me to-morrow
forenoon?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I think he would, miss. He told me to do what you
said, says he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell him, please, that I would like to have you go with
me to-morrow as soon after nine o'clock as you can get
here. I shall want you to show me the building, and identify
the man Patterson."</p>

<p>"That I will, miss, if he's served you any trick."</p>

<p>Poubalov walked very rapidly after he left Mr. Pembroke's.
He could have saved himself many steps by
taking a street-car, but he evidently preferred energetic
action.</p>

<p>Paul, following, took note, as Litizki had done on a
similar occasion, of the streets through which he passed,
and at last he saw him pause and stand for several minutes
at the curb, looking across the road at what seemed
to be an old-fashioned hotel. After a time he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
slowly on, and soon thereafter was joined by a man with
whom he conversed.</p>

<p>Paul went near enough to see the man's face, but he did
not recognize him as anybody he had ever seen before.
The conversation finished, Poubalov continued on his
way, again walking rapidly, but this time, after coming
to Washington Street, he boarded a downtown car. An
open car was directly behind it, and Paul found a place
on its front seat, thus being enabled to keep the spy in
view until he alighted at Scollay Square.</p>

<p>The guilty as well as the innocent must eat, and supper
was the next thing to engage Poubalov's attention. Paul
improved the opportunity in the same way, but he finished
quickly, and waited a long time for the spy to come
forth. He had been watching the restaurant entrance
from a doorway across the street, and at last he ventured
over to see whether possibly his quarry had escaped him.
No; there sat Poubalov, at a table not far from the door,
his head bent down as if he were thinking profoundly.
His supper lay almost untouched before him. Just as
Paul looked in, the head waiter touched the customer on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>Poubalov looked up with a start, and the head waiter
seemed to be apologizing for his intrusion. It was clear
that he had supposed the customer to be asleep, or ill.
Poubalov paid his check and left the place.</p>

<p>He went to his lodging-house, and when Paul saw that
he had lit the gas, he, too, went inside.</p>

<p>He locked the door immediately and applied his eye
to the nail hole.</p>

<p>Poubalov sat with folded arms in an old-fashioned rocking
chair, gazing abstractedly before him. On the little
center table under the chandelier, Paul could just distinguish
Clara's photograph.</p>

<p>Paul remained with his eye at the hole until it seemed
as if he could stand no longer. In all that time Poubalov
had not moved perceptibly.</p>

<p>The watcher got down and looked at his time-piece. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
was half-past ten. He then sat with his head against
the door that he might hear the slightest sound from the
front room.</p>

<p>Just what possessed Paul to be so vigilant on this occasion,
when the spy was doing absolutely nothing but
cudgel his inscrutable mind, he could not have told in
less vague terms than that he didn't want Poubalov to
get away from him. If he were to take a nocturnal, or
early morning ramble, Paul purposed to be on hand to accompany
him.</p>

<p>Something like a half hour passed, and then Paul
heard a long, heavy sigh, and the creak of the rocker as
Poubalov rose. Quickly mounting his perch, Paul saw
him pace back and forth, his hands clinched behind him
and his brow set in hard wrinkles. He seemed to be in
for a night of it, and as his movement promised to be productive
of nothing more than his quiescence, Paul again
dismounted and sat down. So monotonously did the
march continue that the listener's head began to droop,
lulled by the very sound he had set himself to hear, and
had it not been for the extreme anxiety with which he had
undertaken his task, Paul would have fallen asleep. After
twice catching himself nodding, he no longer dared to sit
still. So he rose and stepped lightly about the room to
start the blood in his drowsy limbs.</p>

<p>The sound of marching ceased. Poubalov had stopped
under the chandelier, and when Paul had him in view
he was in the act of turning Clara's photograph face down
upon the table. He took out the leather pocketbook that
had checked the dagger thrust by Litizki's hand, and examined
one of the documents in it attentively. It appeared
to be of an official character, for there was a big seal upon
it, and it was bound with ribbon. Paul could see the
holes made by the dagger in passing through the several
folds of the paper, or parchment.</p>

<p>Poubalov laid the document upon the table, sat down,
and, drawing fresh paper before him, began to write.
His pen traversed the sheets with great rapidity, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Paul could hear the scratching plainly, he again sought
relief from his uncomfortable perch.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o'clock when the sound of writing
ceased.</p>

<p>Paul saw that Poubalov had removed his coat. What
he had written was folded and placed in an envelope upon
the table.</p>

<p>The watcher supposed that the spy was about to retire,
but there was so evidently something further upon
Poubalov's mind, something that he seemed to debate
whether it were best done now, or in the morning, that
Paul kept his place and watched; and as he strained
his eye to take in every movement, instinctively shading
his face although he stood in the darkness, he saw
Poubalov draw a revolver from his hip-pocket.</p>

<p>Placing the hammer at half-cock, he tilted the barrel
forward and pushed the cartridge cylinder about with his
thumb and finger.</p>

<p>Every chamber seemed to be as he wished it, and he
readjusted the barrel.</p>

<p>Then he walked to the bureau upon which swung a half-length
mirror. His back was thus partially turned to
the watcher, and Paul could see dimly the reflection of his
face looking somberly toward him. He held the revolver
in his right hand, the finger on the trigger, the barrel
pointed toward the floor.</p>

<p>Paul was in an agony of doubt and apprehension. What
should he do?</p>

<p>How long would Poubalov stand there and allow him to
reflect?</p>

<p>Would the spy, then, "get away," and by this manner
of exit?</p>

<p>With his left hand Poubalov took his watch from his
pocket. He glanced at the face of the busy and faithful
little machine, and it was only too evident that he had set
the limit of his life at some point that the moving hands
would presently reach.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE NEW CLEW.</p>


<p>Frantic with anxiety and dread, Paul followed a sudden
impulse and jumped to the floor, ran to the door that
opened into the hall, unlocked and opened it and rushed
out.</p>

<p>He had a wild idea of bursting in the door of Poubalov's
room and wrestling with him if need be to take away
the revolver and prevent suicide.</p>

<p>He stopped, startled, just outside his door, for Poubalov
stood before him, the light from the chandelier streaming
out upon him and showing him erect, alert, his revolver
pointed directly at the watcher.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Poubalov, coolly.</p>

<p>Paul caught his breath and leaned upon the banister.</p>

<p>"I was going out in a hurry and stumbled against a
chair," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Strange time of night to do things in a hurry," remarked
Poubalov, still aiming his weapon at the young
man; "do you belong here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I moved in yesterday."</p>

<p>Poubalov stood a little aside to let the light fall more
fully upon Paul's face.</p>

<p>"Humph!" he said, lowering the revolver; then added,
in Russian, "you are Paul Palovna, intimate friend of Ivan
Strobel."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Paul, in the same language, "I am,
and you are his deadly enemy.'</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Poubalov in profound disgust, "you
ought to know better. Come in here&mdash;but no! you are in a
hurry. Go, then; I will talk to you another time."</p>

<p>"Better now, Poubalov," returned Paul, significantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
"one of us might be missing before another opportunity
occurred. I am not so much in a hurry that I cannot listen
to you."</p>

<p>"No!" said the spy, decidedly, "go your way, and take
this comfort with you, Palovna, that you have done your
friend Strobel a service."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and withdrew into his room
and closed the door.</p>

<p>Paul went slowly down the stairs and opened the front
door just as the landlady poked her head from her room
on the ground floor and inquired in an agitated whisper,
"Whatever was the trouble?"</p>

<p>"It is nothing," said Paul, "I stumbled, and the gentleman
in the front room mistook me for a burglar, I guess.
Sorry I disturbed you."</p>

<p>"It's all right," whispered the landlady, "but I guess
he must have scared you some. Your face is as wet as if
you'd been out in a rain."</p>

<p>Paul realized then to what a tense degree his nerves had
been strained.</p>

<p>Perspiration seemed to be oozing from every pore. His
knees felt weak and his head dizzy, but he kept in mind
the part he was playing and left the house. However
certain it was that Poubalov would infer that Strobel's
intimate friend lodged there for the purpose of watching
him, it would never do to openly admit the fact by returning
immediately to his room.</p>

<p>He went to the corner of Bowdoin Street, and back on
the other side to a point directly opposite Poubalov's windows.</p>

<p>As he walked, one deep-toned stroke rang out from a
neighboring church tower.</p>

<p>If that was the hour Poubalov had set for putting a
bullet into his heart, he had let it pass without taking
action.</p>

<p>Paul kept his eyes upon the curtained windows behind
which the chandelier light still glowed, and longed to be
back at his peephole, watching the spy. Yet there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
nothing that he could do if he were there. He had seen
the one great incident in Poubalov's career come to its climax
upon the awful verge of tragedy; and he felt that as
the spy's life trembled in the balance, the weight had
been thrown into the scale for prolonging it by his impulsive
jump from the chair on which he had been viewing
the scene.</p>

<p>Not that Poubalov was hesitating; his was the nerve to
pull the trigger with the precision and steadiness of a
marksman when the appointed time came; but the shock
of irrelevant circumstances had been just what was needed
to release the morbid pressure of gloomy contemplation
from the brain, and restore it to its normal activity.</p>

<p>Thus Paul reflected, with his eyes upon the lighted windows.
A party of roysterers swung into the place, singing
discordantly. One of them fell at the corner of Bowdoin
Street, and his companions helped him up with drunken
jeers and laughter. Paul had turned his head to watch
them, and when he looked again at the lodging-house
across the way, all the windows were dark. Poubalov had
gone to bed.</p>

<p>As faithful as the unfortunate Litizki to his task, Paul
sat up all that night. When drowsiness overcame him, he
bathed his face and head with water, or walked gently
about the room. He smoked all the cigarettes in his possession,
for the sake of having something to do, and when
his stock was exhausted, he went to a neighboring "all-night"
restaurant and bought a handful of cigars. He listened
through the hours for any suggestive sound from
the front room, but, beyond an occasional deep breath, he
heard nothing.</p>

<p>Poubalov slept well.</p>

<p>It was not until the day, reckoning by the light, was
well advanced, that the spy rose and dressed. While he
was still busy with his toilet, a messenger called and left
a note for Paul with word to the scrub-woman who was
already at work, that it was to be delivered at once. It
was from Clara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"A new clew," she wrote, "and the most promising one
thus far, has been brought to me this evening. I need help
in following it to the end. Owing to my uncle's indisposition,
I do not feel like even telling him about it, much
less asking him to give me his time. Can you come? I
know you are doing much, and quite likely taking time
that you ought to devote to work, but I ask some further
assistance, nevertheless, knowing that it is not necessary
for me to plead. This is so important that I believe you
can leave Poubalov for a while, no matter what he is doing.
Please come by nine o'clock if you possibly can."</p>

<p>Paul had great faith in Clara, although he had not
known with sufficient detail of her recent work to give
her judgment all the credit that it deserved, and so he
found himself in an annoying quandary. To him it seemed
essential to follow Poubalov now that he was well in
view.</p>

<p>He felt, too, some disappointment at being called away
without being able to feel that his night had been spent
sleeplessly to some purpose.</p>

<p>It could not be that Clara had discovered anything of
great importance compared to the developments that
would probably follow a patient tracking of Poubalov's
footsteps during the day.</p>

<p>Why hadn't she mentioned what her clew was? No,
she depended upon him to obey her implicitly, as if he
had no more discretion than Litizki.</p>

<p>If Paul was a bit unreasonable and restive, let it be
charged against his fatigue. Few men can keep an even
temper when the nerves are unstrung and the whole body
cries for rest. Poubalov saved him from the error, if so it
was, of disregarding Clara's wishes. It came about in this
way:</p>

<p>Paul climbed to his observation perch, to see how matters
stood in the next room. Poubalov had opened the
envelope containing the papers he had been at work upon
during the midnight hour, and was now destroying them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
burning them one sheet at a time over the wash-bowl that
he had set upon the center table.</p>

<p>He was fully dressed, even to the hat on his head, and
Paul carefully replaced the nail which protected his peephole.</p>

<p>He stood by the chair with Clara's letter in his hand,
still undecided what course to take, when there was a
knock at his door.</p>

<p>He opened, and Poubalov stood there.</p>

<p>"You can spare the time now, I suppose?" he said inquiringly
with a grim glance at the valentine hanging
from the improvised hook.</p>

<p>Paul saw that his ruse was discovered, but he followed
the spy into the front room, his heart beating high with
expectation.</p>

<p>"There is never an effect without a cause, young man,"
remarked Poubalov, motioning Paul to a chair; "the effect
was sufficient for me last night, and so far as your act
deserves it, you have my thanks. This morning I sought
the cause, and of course, I found it. Do not be disturbed.
I have no reproaches to make. You imagined yourself at
war with me, and you took your own methods to win.
There is nothing to complain of in that; but you, as a Russian
of intelligence, should have known that I could not
be as hostile as you think to an American citizen. Bah!
it's not worth discussing! You've all lost your heads.</p>

<p>"What I have to say is this: I am on duty for the czar,
and having recovered from my dangerous temptation to
be derelict, I shall do what duty demands, without let or
hindrance from anybody. I will tolerate no interference,
no matter whose fair lips give the command. When that
little wretch, Litizki, was in that chair where you are now
sitting, I sought to influence him by threats against himself.
I don't take that method with you, Paul Palovna. If
you choose to do so, you can dog my footsteps from now
on, for I presume your American laws will not protect
me in my desire to work undisturbed; but bear in mind
that I have no more love for Ivan Strobel now than I ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
had, and if I see fit to release him, it must be I, Alexander
Poubalov, who chooses to do so of his own free will.
Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Sufficiently to see that you would frighten me from my
course by threats against the man whom you have in
your power, and whom I am trying to rescue."</p>

<p>"You do well," continued Poubalov; "and if you are in
any doubt as to whether I am in earnest, I advise you to
report what I have said, and what you saw in this room
last night, to Miss Hilman. She will tell you whether I am
likely to be gratuitously merciful. Spy upon me, therefore,
if you like. I shall know that you defy me, and you
will have to bear the consequences. Shall we breakfast together,
Paul Palovna?"</p>

<p>Paul ignored the ironical invitation, which was Poubalov's
way of saying that he has said his say, and remarked:</p>

<p>"I also have a suggestion to make."</p>

<p>Poubalov raised his brows in contemptuous surprise that
anything could be added to his statement of the situation.</p>

<p>"You have spoken of American law," said Paul, "and
I simply suggest that the friends of Strobel may to-day
resort to law to obtain his freedom. I don't know how
much you may have said to Litizki and Miss Hilman, but
you have made some damaging admissions to me."</p>

<p>"Really! is that all you can think of? It's hardly worth
a reply, but I will suggest in return that what you call my
admissions are your own inferences, nothing more. Ask
the nearest police captain, or, better, go to the public prosecutor
with your imaginings. I will tell you that there
isn't a scrap of evidence on which to base my arrest, for
that, of course, is what you aim at. You are more of a
child than I thought you were, with all your petty contrivances
for peeping upon a Russian official. Au revoir,
Palovna."</p>

<p>Paul went downstairs in a rage, impressed, as all were
whoever came in contact with this remarkable man, with
Poubalov's faculty for gaining and keeping a masterful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
control over the situation. The worst of it was, the spy
was probably entirely in the right so far as law was concerned.</p>

<p>As well arrest himself, Palovna, as this foreigner who
had shown his interest in the Strobel case in eccentric
ways, perhaps, but who could not be charged with criminality,
unless possibly by Litizki, and the tailor had himself
made it impossible that he should be of any further
service.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no course open to him but to respect
Clara's wishes, and, accordingly, out to Roxbury he
went.</p>

<p>He arrived at Mr. Pembroke's house just before nine
o'clock, and found Clara waiting for him, dressed to go
out.</p>

<p>They exchanged information while waiting for Mike
to come, Clara telling about the discovery of Patterson,
and Paul giving a guarded account of Poubalov's contemplated
suicide.</p>

<p>He tried to spare Clara the horrors of the scene, but
he felt that she ought to know how deeply in earnest
Poubalov was, that she might the more correctly judge
him and estimate the value of his threats.</p>

<p>"It must have been a dreadful moment," she said when
he had finished, "and I am glad that another tragedy has
been averted. It is hard to believe that he will go to extreme
measures&mdash;but what am I saying? What has he not
done that is cruel, barbarous and wicked? How can I expect
anything but unmixed evil from such a man? I believe
it is well that for a time we can appear to withdraw
our observations of him."</p>

<p>Mike was late, but when he did come he came with a
coupé.</p>

<p>"Me boss said, miss," he explained, "that if there was
to be any travelin', you was to ride as far an' as long as
you liked, with his compliments."</p>

<p>"Your employer is very kind," said Clara. "This gentleman,
Mr. Palovna, will go with me, and if he asks you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to do anything, you needn't wait for my consent. We will
go straight to the place where you left Patterson. Stop
there, and point out the house you think he went into, but
don't drive up to it."</p>

<p>When they were in the coupé, Clara continued to Paul:</p>

<p>"I have no definite plan as to Patterson. That must develop
when we find him. If he can be cajoled, bribed or
frightened into telling us the truth, it must be done. I
don't see that we are called upon to make nice discriminations
in our methods."</p>

<p>"Any way is fair in dealing with a criminal," returned
Paul. "Humph!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Clara, observing that he began to
take a lively interest in the street through which they
were passing.</p>

<p>"It may be only a coincidence," said Paul, "but it just
occurred to me that thus far Mike has taken us over exactly
the same course that Poubalov pursued when I followed
him last evening."</p>

<p>"I presume it's not a coincidence," responded Clara,
and she thought of Litizki's passionate words: "If ever
anything is discovered, you discover Poubalov's hand in
it."</p>

<p>Step by step the coupé followed Poubalov's line of
march, and when it drew up at last, it was at the very
corner where Paul had seen the spy talking with the
stranger.</p>

<p>Mike got down and opened the door, and as he
spoke, Clara looked out in the direction in which he
pointed.</p>

<p>"This was where Patterson shook me, miss," he said,
"an' I seen him go along down the street an' cross over
just below there an' go into a house&mdash;that one, I think,
with the balcony along the front, the one a gentleman is
just comin' out of."</p>

<p>Clara drew back into the coupé hastily. The gentleman
coming from the house in question was Poubalov, and he
was walking toward them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A STUBBORN ANTAGONIST.</p>


<p>"Stay just where you are, Michael," exclaimed Clara,
"and don't let that man see your face."</p>

<p>Mike did as directed, pushing his head and shoulders
far into the coupé and whispering:</p>

<p>"It isn't him, is it, miss, who's got anything to do with
the case?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied in a low tone, while she and Paul
kept as far back in the gloom of the carriage as they
could; "have you ever seen him before?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm, he was down to the stables the day this gentleman
called, askin' would I know the man who did the
trick to me wheel."</p>

<p>"It was a ruse," muttered Paul; "he pretended to investigate
in the same spirit that I did so as to throw suspicion
from himself. If he has anything like the perceptions
that we think he has, he will recognize this rig. Isn't
it the same, Mike, with which you started to take Mr.
Strobel to his wedding?"</p>

<p>"Identical, sir, horse an' all."</p>

<p>Poubalov had passed them during this brief conversation,
and as none of them had ventured to look at him,
they could not tell whether or not he recognized the
turnout.</p>

<p>They could hear his rapid steps as he strode along,
and there was certainly no pause to indicate that
he had seen anything that surprised or interested him.</p>

<p>"I must know where he goes," said Clara. "Get on the
box, Michael, and drive after him without letting him see,
if you can help it, that you are following him. Let us
know if he enters any house, but do not stop in front of
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes'm," replied Mike, closing the door.</p>

<p>He turned the vehicle about and drove slowly to the
corner.</p>

<p>Poubalov had paused, ostensibly to buy a paper at a
news-stand a little way up the street. He glanced
back at the approaching vehicle, shrugged his shoulders,
and moved on as rapidly as before. Mike reported this to
Clara a few minutes later, when he had seen Poubalov
board a Scollay Square car.</p>

<p>"He is satisfied that we are following him, then," said
Clara, and she felt afraid as she recalled the threats that
the spy had uttered to Paul.</p>

<p>Would he proceed promptly to put into execution whatever
design he might have for injuring Ivan? Would not
the disappointed passion that had led him to all but the
commission of suicide now prompt him to murder his
prisoner?</p>

<p>Clara sank back and covered her face with her hands,
completely unnerved for the moment by the seeming imminence
of catastrophe.</p>

<p>"When will the end come!" she moaned.</p>

<p>Mike looked on in honest and surprised distress, and
Paul himself, knowing as he did the reasons for her excess
of fear, was at his wits' end to suggest comfort.</p>

<p>Clara uncovered her eyes suddenly. They blazed with
new determination.</p>

<p>"Michael," she cried, "could you overtake the car he is
on?"</p>

<p>"I could try it, miss, but he's got a pretty good start."</p>

<p>"Try it, then. Don't spare the horse for just this once.
If you come near to catching up, and he looks around,
then drive more slowly, as if you were not able to keep
up the pace, and finally stop altogether, let the car get
away, and I'll tell you what to do next. Hurry!"</p>

<p>Mike did hurry.</p>

<p>The coupé started with a jolt as he lashed his astonished
horse into a gallop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's your plan, Miss Hilman?" asked Paul, who was
at a loss to account for this projected maneuver.</p>

<p>"The man wants us to follow him," she replied, turning
upon her companion almost fiercely in the intensity of her
excitement. "He would lead us away from the scene of
his operations, don't you see? Since he has discovered
that you have been watching him, he has thought it all
over, and he has concluded that it is more than likely that
you tracked him to that street, for that was the street,
wasn't it? Of course! Then he would naturally expect me
to go there. I don't dream that he foresaw meeting us just
now, but what I do believe to be the case is, that finding
that house insecure for his purpose, he is now planning to
remove his prisoner, and happening upon us as he did, he
will do what he can to lead us away from it. Don't you
see?"</p>

<p>"It sounds reasonable; and you plan, then, to make a
pretense at a desperate effort to catch up with him, and
when he has got away a considerable distance, to return
to the house and investigate."</p>

<p>"That's it," and Clara again sank back, but this time her
face expressed energy and confidence in success.</p>

<p>"I wonder how we are getting on," she said after a moment.
They were dashing along Washington Street now
at a furious rate, attracting attention from all passers.
Paul tried to look ahead, but he could not do so without
leaning far out of the coupé, and that did not seem to be
advisable.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Clara; "I think the driver can be
trusted to play his part, if his horse doesn't play it for
him by falling down from exhaustion. By the way, I
had a letter from O'Brien this morning. You don't know
who he is, do you? He is the employee at the Park Square
Station who saw Billings drive up, and who says that a
man left the carriage and went into the station. The detectives,
you know, supposed that man to be Ivan. It's a small
point, but O'Brien very kindly wrote to me when he discovered
it. He says he was talking about the case with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
fellow-workman who remembered the occurrence, and
who says that shortly after Billings was seen by O'Brien,
a closed carriage stopped at the Columbus Avenue entrance
to the station, near the baggage rooms, you know,
and that a man left the station and got in. Of course that
was the carriage Billings drove, and the man was doubtless
the same who got out at the front entrance. He had simply
walked through the station, mingled with the crowd, perhaps
going so far as to buy a ticket for New York, and
then had rejoined his driver. Doesn't it seem clear?"</p>

<p>"It's a perfectly plausible explanation of the point, but
it's a pity O'Brien's friend didn't turn up with it sooner.
You might have been saved your journey to New York."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure about that. I am not sorry that I saw Lizzie
White, although I never felt for an instant that Ivan
had eloped."</p>

<p>The coupé was still rattling onward at the highest speed
the horse could attain, but a moment after Clara had finished,
it came to a sudden halt, and they heard a stern
voice saying:</p>

<p>"You know better than to drive so fast in the street!
I've a great mind to take you in."</p>

<p>Mike was protesting in characteristic fashion, inventing
something about the necessity of catching a train, when
Clara opened the coupé door and stepped out. A policeman
stood at the horse's head, glaring with offended dignity
at the driver.</p>

<p>"If there is any fault it is mine, officer," she said
sweetly; "please scold me, for I told him to drive as fast
as he could."</p>

<p>"That don't make no difference, ma'am," returned the
policeman, instantly mollified, but still feeling it incumbent
upon him to assert the majesty of municipal ordinances;
"he's a regular, and he knew better. 'Tain't allowed
to go so fast anywhere in Boston 'less it's on a race
track."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," said Clara.</p>

<p>"Go on with you," commanded the policeman to Mike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"and be a little more careful. It would be rough on me,
you see," he added to Clara, "if I wasn't to stop him."</p>

<p>Mike looked inquiringly down at his passenger.</p>

<p>"Come to the door a minute, Michael," she said, and
returned to the coupé.</p>

<p>"That cop's too fresh to live," remarked Mike as he
put his head in to receive instructions.</p>

<p>"Were we anywhere near the car?" asked Clara.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, we was most onto it, an' I was just goin' to
pull up a bit when the cop got in his work."</p>

<p>"Could you see the man we were after?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm; he turned round, an' I guess he saw what the
cop did, but I lost sight of him tryin' to keep me horse
from treadin' on the cop's toes."</p>

<p>"It's just as well, then," said Clara, satisfied. "I'm
rather glad the policeman stopped us, for now Poubalov
will be certain why it was that we didn't catch up. You
needn't hurry so now, Michael; drive back to the place
where we started from."</p>

<p>"Where Patterson shook me, miss? All right. I'm on,"
and he clambered back to the box.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred to disturb their return journey, and
when Mike again opened the door for instructions, Clara
and Paul got out.</p>

<p>"We will go straight to the house and inquire for Patterson,"
said Clara, "and if we don't find him there, we'll
ask all along the street."</p>

<p>"Whist, miss!" exclaimed Mike, in his eagerness gripping
her arm; "there goes Patterson now!"</p>

<p>"Where?" she cried, looking, of course, in the wrong
direction.</p>

<p>"Below there, him on the box of the closed carriage,
miss. On my soul, it looks like the same&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Follow it quick, Michael," she said excitedly. "Come,
Paul!" and she sprang into the coupé.</p>

<p>"I'll sit on the box with Mike," answered Paul, tremendously
aroused; he was already climbing to a place beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the driver; "from here I can act quicker. Hit her up,
Mike!"</p>

<p>So off they went on another pursuit, Mike treating his
horse to more lash than he had ever experienced before.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you'll need to go so fast as to risk
arrest," said Paul; "Patterson probably don't suspect
that we are after him, and it would be better to go a little
slower than to be stopped again by a policeman."</p>

<p>"I almost ran down one cop who tried to make me pull
up before," responded Mike, through set teeth, "an' I
wouldn't mind bein' took in myself if it wasn't for spoilin'
the game. I'll look sharp, sir, never fear."</p>

<p>Patterson and his carriage had disappeared around a
corner almost before the coupé had started, but they were
soon in view again, jogging forward at a rather lively
rate several blocks ahead.</p>

<p>"Will I overhaul him, sir, right away?" asked Mike.
"I could do it by driving like sin."</p>

<p>"Don't risk it," answered Paul; "as long as he is in
sight, I shan't worry if we gain a little at every block.
Let's not drive fast enough to attract attention, for we
may have a row when we catch him, and the less crowd
around the better."</p>

<p>"If there's to be a fight," said Mike, with a hopeful grin,
"I can do Patterson. I'm not even with him yet for doin'
the trick to me wheel."</p>

<p>"All right. If it comes to a scrimmage, you look after
him, and I'll try to attend to the passengers. I'll tell you
just what we suspect, so that you can understand what
you are to do. If we're not mistaken, Mr. Strobel is in
that carriage, helplessly bound. There may be another
man with him. In any case, we must get Strobel away
and put him in the coupé. When that is done, you drive
straight to Mr. Pembroke's. Don't wait for Miss Hilman
or me if we don't happen to get in. We'll take care of ourselves.
You look out for Mr. Strobel. Call the police to
help if you need to, for we've nothing to fear from the
law."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm on," said Mike.</p>

<p>The chase went on to the perfect satisfaction of Palovna,
who, with growing excitement, saw the distance between
him and Patterson's carriage gradually decreasing. His
one fear now was that Strobel would be found to be seriously
injured, and he felt a great dread lest Poubalov in
his madness had killed him! He would not dwell upon
this thought, however, concentrating all his force on the
struggle that would probably ensue when the closed carriage
was at last overtaken.</p>

<p>They were now in Washington Street, and again going
toward the city.</p>

<p>Patterson was less than a block away.</p>

<p>"Give it to him now, Mike," said Paul; "get right
alongside and make him pull up."</p>

<p>Mike nodded and gave his horse a smart cut with the
whip. He sprang forward at a gallop. Patterson was
driving near the curb, and Mike took the outside. He
drove close beside the closed carriage, in order to
"pocket" his adversary and so compel him to pull up. The
maneuver succeeded admirably.</p>

<p>Taken by surprise at the sudden appearance of a rapidly
galloping horse very near his wheels, Patterson reined
his pair nearer to the curb, uttering an impatient curse
at the carelessness of the other driver. Mike forced
him over still further, and Patterson was compelled in
self-defense to stop.</p>

<p>As he did so he turned his head to tell Mike what he
thought of him, and Paul recognized the stranger whom
he had seen in conversation with Poubalov.</p>

<p>The two drivers exchanged angry words that would
look rather worse in print, if possible, than they sounded,
and Paul lost no time in descending to the ground. The
vehicles were too close together to admit of going between
them, so he ran around to the sidewalk and wrenched
open the carriage door.</p>

<p>Then he stood stock still.</p>

<p>The carriage was empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Clara was beside him in an instant, and though her face
fell, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Shut the door and stop the quarrel. I must speak to
Patterson."</p>

<p>Everything had happened so quickly that the two
drivers were still on their respective boxes, making
remarks to each other, when Paul stopped upon the wheel
beside Patterson and said:</p>

<p>"Mike, drive up to the curb just in front of us. Get
down, Patterson. We've something to say to you."</p>

<p>Patterson looked down in surprise, glanced at Clara,
shook his head and gathered up the reins for a fresh
start.</p>

<p>Paul sprang from the wheel and caught the horses by
the bits before they had taken a step.</p>

<p>Mike was carrying out instructions and was then just
abreast of him.</p>

<p>"Mike!" said Paul in a loud voice, "don't stop, but
pick up the first policeman you can find and bring him
here in a hurry! We'll talk to this man in a cell if he
won't wait here."</p>

<p>Patterson was unquestionably alarmed at this.</p>

<p>"What is it you want?" he asked in a surly tone.</p>

<p>"Get down, and the lady there will tell you," answered
Paul.</p>

<p>Patterson prepared to obey, but just then a south-bound
car stopped near them, and Poubalov alighted. He came
rapidly toward the group, his dark face darker yet with
passion.</p>

<p>"Stay on the box!" he commanded. He took off his hat,
bowed stiffly to Clara, with one hand on the carriage
door, and said:</p>

<p>"This is my carriage, Miss Hilman. Drive on, James,"
and before even quick-witted Clara could interpose a
restraining word, the door had closed upon Poubalov, and

<p class="center">HIDE AND SEEK.</p>


<p>Clara's face was deathly pale, and in her heart anger
burned as hotly at Poubalov's ceremonious insolence as it
ached with this fresh blow to her hopes. Paul, blue with
despair, feared for her, but she had not yet met the emergency
that was too great for her to contend with, however
unsuccessful she might be.</p>

<p>"We must waste no time here!" she cried stepping
quickly forward to the coupé. "Return to that house,
Paul, and search it; do what you think is best, according
to developments. I am going to pursue Poubalov as I said
I would. If I do not hear from you before the day is over,
Paul, I shall go to that house myself. If you have to go
downtown, leave word at Mrs. White's. Keep that carriage
in view, Michael, but don't try to overtake it.
Good-by, Paul!"</p>

<p>Her voice quivered with the desperation that had driven
the tears to the brink of her eyes, and she hastily entered
the coupé and pulled down the window curtains. Thus
shut out from view, she gave way freely to her overstrained
emotions, her soul seeming to be borne along on
a rushing torrent of grief, and she felt that appalling
desire, than which there is no more shocking experience
of the heart, to throw herself into the arms of the lost
loved one and find comfort there.</p>

<p>It was a great day for sturdy Mike. The regret that he
hadn't had time just now to "lambast" his friend Patterson,
was sweetly assuaged by the fact that he was still
pursuing the loafer who did the trick to his wheel, and the
hope that another opportunity would soon offer for a fine
fight.</p>

<p>The chase exhilarated him, and the thought that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
was called upon to champion a beautiful woman, made
his fists ache to do valiant service upon somebody's head,
Patterson's preferred, and he thumped his knees gently
with his knuckles by way of practice, and kept his horse
at a brisk trot a few rods behind Poubalov's carriage.</p>

<p>He was quite confident that he could "do" both driver
and passenger if such a thing were necessary, and he
longed heartily for an occasion to demand a trial of his
prowess.</p>

<p>After having traversed a considerable distance, he
pulled up, got down and gently opened the door.</p>

<p>"Whist, miss," he said, "they've stopped entirely."</p>

<p>"Where are we, and where are they?" asked Clara, now
her composed self again.</p>

<p>"In Scollay Square," answered Mike, "and they're just
foreninst the Crawford House. The gentleman's talkin' to
Patterson. Now he's lookin' at me, bad luck to him!"</p>

<p>"I don't wish to come up to him," said Clara; "if he
comes this way I shall be glad. You must have no fear
if we talk angrily together."</p>

<p>"I'd like to&mdash;&mdash;" began Mike, significantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you would," she interrupted, "but we
must have no trouble unless I give the word. I might do
so if I thought a policeman would arrest him, and not
you."</p>

<p>"As to that, miss," said Mike, ruefully, "any copper's
more likely to pull in the poor cab-driver instead of the
fine gentleman. My brother's on the force, an' if we was
only on his beat, now!"</p>

<p>"Tell me what they are doing, please."</p>

<p>"The gentleman is going into the hotel. Patterson is
starting away. Shall I follow him?"</p>

<p>Clara reflected just an instant.</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "Stay here. I'm not going to
pursue another empty carriage."</p>

<p>"Huh!" chuckled Mike, "you're a keen one, sure, for
that's just what he's wantin' you to do. Patterson has
turned down Hanover Street."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll wait until he comes back," said Clara, "if we
have to spend the rest of the day here; but you watch the
hotel&mdash;Stay! there's a side entrance to the Crawford
House, isn't there? Can you place the coupé where you
can see both doors?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't know how long the police will let me
stay there."</p>

<p>"Try it, please. If they make you move on, drive around
the square and come back."</p>

<p>Mike accordingly drove up to the curb of Tremont Row,
where he could look down Brattle Street. No policeman
had disturbed him before Patterson turned from Cornhill
into the square. He had driven around a few blocks, evidently
for the purpose of testing the design of his pursuers.
Clara wondered why Poubalov should permit such
a chase to continue. It would have seemed more like him
to come to her with some of his characteristic sophistry,
and either appear to yield, or adopt an entirely different
course. It must be that he had some plan in view to the
execution of which Patterson and his closed carriage were
essential.</p>

<p>Patterson drove to the front entrance of the hotel and
waited, casting ugly glances across the square at Mike, who
grinned complacently and shook his fist.</p>

<p>After a moment Poubalov came out, entered the carriage,
and Patterson promptly drove away. It was plain as
day that he had received his instructions while Poubalov
stood on the side-walk at the time of their arrival there.
He was to see whether Clara would persist in her pursuit,
and if so he was to&mdash;and that remained to be seen.</p>

<p>Mike speedily resumed the reins, and again the chase
was in progress. Patterson went down Hanover Street,
and, without any apparent effort to distance his pursuer,
kept on until he came to Fleet Street, which leads to one of
the East Boston ferries.</p>

<p>He turned in there, and Mike lost a little by reason of a
temporary jam of vehicles. As soon as he was out of it,
he too went through Fleet Street, and saw, to his satisfaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
that Patterson was still but a short distance ahead.</p>

<p>With painful anxiety, however, he saw that Patterson
was making for the ferry, before which a rapidly
increasing line of vehicles stood waiting for a chance
to cross. Mike whipped up energetically, and managed
to beat several drays and express wagons on the way
in, and when at last he had to pull up and take his place
in line, Patterson's was the carriage directly in front of
him.</p>

<p>"Smart, ain't ye, ye loafer!" said Mike, disdainfully.</p>

<p>Patterson did not notice this remark, or any other of
the many with which Mike assailed him while they waited
for an incoming boat to discharge its cargo. When at
length the gates were opened for the waiting vehicles,
Mike was on the alert to take advantage of any opening
that might occur to enable him to forge ahead, but none
occurred.</p>

<p>Policemen and ferry officials kept the teams to their
places, and if Mike had attempted a trick, he would have
been compelled to go back, and thus lose more than he
could have gained.</p>

<p>One by one the carriages and wagons went on board,
and just after Patterson had passed the barrier the gates
were closed.</p>

<p>"Hold on there!" howled Mike, beside himself with
disappointment and rage, "don't yees see I've got to get
aboard?"</p>

<p>The gateman laughed and told him to make himself
easy; and Patterson, from his place at the very stern of
the ferryboat, stood up in his seat and beckoned to Mike
ironically.</p>

<p>The unhappy chap fumed in vain and got down to tell
Clara about it.</p>

<p>"We're shook, miss, shook entirely," he said despondently.</p>

<p>When Clara understood the unfortunate meaning of his
words, and saw that Poubalov had won in another skirmish,
she herself was in a quandary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are two ferries, aren't there?" she asked.
"Aren't they near enough together on this side to make it
possible to watch both for their return? for, of course,
they haven't gone to East Boston for any other purpose
than to come back here again unperceived."</p>

<p>"That might possibly be done, miss," said Mike, after a
look at the jam of vehicles behind him, "but we're in for
a trip across anyways, for I couldn't turn 'round now.
An' then, d'ye see, there's more ways to get back from
East Boston. They might go over to Chelsea, an' come
back by that ferry, or take a run around by road and
bridge, so you'd best give 'em up as lost, miss, an' it's
sorry I am to tell you so."</p>

<p>"Well," said Clara sighing, "if we have to cross, we
can make inquiries on the other side, and possibly come
up with them again. We'll try it."</p>

<p>Inquiries on the East Boston side were vain when they
landed there ten minutes later.</p>

<p>No one to whom they spoke could remember whether
a carriage such as they described had been across or not.</p>

<p>One man, anxious to parade information that he did
not possess, thought vaguely that the carriage might have
gone thus and so, and Clara instructed Mike to drive that
way a short distance, and then to return to Boston by the
other ferry.</p>

<p>This was done, and all trace of Poubalov having been
lost, and but one more hope remaining to her&mdash;Paul's
investigation of the house in Roxbury&mdash;she directed Mike
to drive to Ashburton Place.</p>

<p>Paul had arrived at Mrs. White's a few minutes ahead
of her.</p>

<p>"I waited for you," he said in a disheartened voice,
"because I'm completely at a loss what to do next, not
because I have anything of importance to say."</p>

<p>"Everything is of importance, Paul," replied Clara, finding
herself now called upon to inspire her allies with
courage as well as give them ideas. "You went to that
quaint-looking house, of course?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it's an abandoned tavern&mdash;that is, it was formerly
run as a hotel, but the enterprise was a failure, and it is
now closed. I learned that much from a man who was
passing while I stood under the balcony, waiting for somebody
to answer my ring. He remarked that he didn't
believe I'd find anybody at home, as the house had been
practically deserted for some time."</p>

<p>"But we saw Poubalov come out of there this morning,"
urged Clara.</p>

<p>"I said as much to my informant, but he answered that
it was probably somebody who had been looking it over
with a view to purchase. Of course we know better, but it
goes to show that neither Patterson nor anybody else lives
there."</p>

<p>"Except Ivan, if he still lives," said Clara gravely.</p>

<p>"Don't think I forgot that possibility," returned Paul,
earnestly. "I quietly tried the door after my informant
had passed on; he didn't know the name of the owner, by
the way. Of course the door was locked. I went around
to the side and back, for there is a driveway there leading
to stables that are apparently as little used as the tavern
itself. Every door and every window was closed. I
knocked and shouted, and then neighbors put their heads
out of windows and advised me that I was making a noise
to no purpose. If it had been night I would have burst
open a door or window, and have gone through the house
from roof to cellar, but that plan is rather impracticable
by daylight."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Clara, "if the law would allow a search
of that building. I mean something to be done officially.
I've heard of search-warrants."</p>

<p>"It's barely possible, and you might try it; but my
idea, such as it is, would be to go there quietly to-night
ourselves, and force an entrance."</p>

<p>"And in either case Poubalov might return during the
day, and effect a change in the situation that would make
the search useless."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Paul, gloomily, "I had thought of that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"The house must be watched this afternoon," said
Clara, decidedly, "but it is my very distinct impression
that Poubalov will go to his lodging before he returns to
Roxbury. It seems to me he must have been on his way
there when he was compelled to make a long detour to
elude us. And that means that I think his lodging should
be watched as carefully as the abandoned tavern. Will
you pass the afternoon in your room, Paul?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, unless there is a better way of watching
there. You must remember that Poubalov has discovered
my peephole."</p>

<p>"Then," said Clara, "we will borrow the little front
hall room occupied by the young lady. Let us go down at
once."</p>

<p>On this occasion Mrs. White had left them to themselves,
much to Clara's relief, for she would not have cared again
to discuss her plans in the good lady's presence. It was
not that she distrusted Mrs. White's intentions, but she
had proven before that she was exceedingly pliable in
Poubalov's hands.</p>

<p>As they were ready to go, Clara sought Mrs. White
to say good-by.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you are going so soon," said the landlady;
"I thought you and Mr. Palovna would want a long talk,
and so I busied myself in the kitchen, for fear I couldn't
help interrupting to tell you my own good news. I expect
Lizzie home to-night."</p>

<p>"Do you, indeed?" exclaimed Clara; "I am really very
glad for you."</p>

<p>"It seems better, doesn't it?" continued Mrs. White,
anxious to talk to somebody, and eager for sympathy;
"she hasn't told me a word in her letters about why she
went away, but, of course, I suspected; and I think from
the way she writes in the letter I got this morning that
she feels better, poor thing! At any rate, she's coming,
and I feel very happy, and I should be perfectly content if
only you could be happy, too, Miss Hilman."</p>

<p>"That seems almost an impossible boon for me now,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
replied Clara, gently; "I shall come to see you and your
daughter if she would like to have me."</p>

<p>"I am sure she would, Miss Hilman. Must you hurry?"</p>

<p>Every minute seemed so precious to Clara that she
almost begrudged the brief interval spent in this exchange
of courtesies. On the way to Bulfinch Place she
told Paul again that she should manage to watch the
tavern during the afternoon, "but," she added, "you are
most likely to meet important developments, and you will
know where to find me, either near the tavern, or at my
uncle's. I shall try to watch the tavern in such a way as
not to frighten off Poubalov should he wish to go in, but
once he should enter, I shall follow him, you may be
sure."</p>

<p>At the lodging-house Clara made herself known to the
occupant of the front hall room, who was at the time home
for luncheon.</p>

<p>Clara talked with her apart at length, telling her in a
general way of her troubles, but not indicating her plans
in detail.</p>

<p>The young woman had not come in contact with Poubalov
at all, it seemed.</p>

<p>She hardly knew that he was a lodger in the house,
and the upshot of it was that her sympathies were
aroused, and Paul was installed in her room, where he
could keep watch upon the roadway through the slats of
the closed blinds. So once more Clara bade him good-by,
and set forth on her own task.</p>

<p>Paul did not venture to keep himself awake by smoking
in the young lady's room, and he therefore had a dreadfully
hard time of it, for the entire afternoon passed without
an event of any kind to break the monotony of his
watch.</p>

<p>The young lady returned at six o'clock, and looked
in for a moment before going to dinner. After that she
sat gossiping with the landlady.</p>

<p>The sun set and twilight gathered, and Paul began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
fear that Poubalov had changed his quarters without
giving notice; but just before it was too dark to distinguish
faces in the street below, a carriage stopped before
the door and Paul saw that Patterson sat on the
box.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.</p>


<p>"About this hour, one week ago to-day," thought Clara
as she took her place again in the coupé, "I should have
been getting into a carriage at the church door, with Ivan,
as his wife! What an eternity seems to have passed since
then! Will the search and the waiting never end?"</p>

<p>There were no tears now, no disposition to give way.
The dull ache at her heart was there, and it seemed as if
it would stay forever, but all emotion now was held in
check by her determination not to let the day pass without
a decisive investigation of this latest clew that had
so far led to so much racing about, and thus far, too, to
the utter defeat of her every plan.</p>

<p>"Where to, miss?" asked Mike who had been standing
at the coupé door.</p>

<p>Clara had forgotten him for the moment, forgotten
even where she was.</p>

<p>Aroused to the work in hand, she debated for about
one second whether to appeal to a lawyer to get a search-warrant
for her.</p>

<p>She dismissed the suggestion as likely to involve too
much delay. She had never had any experience in law
suits, but she had that general conviction due to the
accepted phrase "the law's delay," that no one should
resort to the courts unless there were ample time and to
spare.</p>

<p>"We will go first to my uncle's house," she said, "and I
would like to have you take such a route that you will
pass the house where we saw Poubalov and Patterson this
forenoon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"An' I s'pose I'm to let you know if I see what's-his-name
or Patterson on the way?"</p>

<p>"By all means! do not stop unless you do."</p>

<p>The half hour's drive to Roxbury was without adventure.
Clara now had the curtains of the coupé up, and she
glanced from side to side through the windows as they
rolled along, ever alert to catch any sign of her adversaries.</p>

<p>The old tavern looked, indeed, deserted.</p>

<p>It needed but a touch of moss or ivy, to suggest a ruin,
for it was not only an ancient building, but sadly out
of repair as well.</p>

<p>After they had passed beyond it a little way, Clara
signaled to Mike to stop.</p>

<p>"I dare not leave this place unguarded a moment," she
said; "there is no telling when Poubalov will return, but
I must go home for a very short time, or there will be
anxiety and perhaps search for me. Suppose you stay
here till I come back. It won't take me long if I go by car.
Please, Michael, don't do anything rash. There was another
good fellow, not so sensible as you, poor man! who
tried to help me, and he got himself into dreadful trouble
over it. This man, Poubalov, is a terrible enemy,
Michael."</p>

<p>"Is he the sort that carries a gun in one pocket and a
razor in another?" asked Mike with perfect seriousness.</p>

<p>"He goes well armed," replied Clara, earnestly, "and
he has neither conscience nor fear. You know what I
want to accomplish, Michael, but if any life is risked to
save another's, it must be mine. I shall be very much displeased
if anything serious happens while I am gone.
Wait for me, sure."</p>

<p>"All right, miss," said Mike, resignedly; "if anything
happens after you get back, though, you bet I'll take a
hand in!"</p>

<p>And if there had been any temptation for a scrimmage
during Clara's absence, there is no manner of doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Mike would have taken part in it in spite of her injunctions.</p>

<p>Clara found Louise in a very nervous condition.</p>

<p>"I have not been so much worried about you, dear,"
she said, "for I have learned to feel confidence that you
can take care of yourself. Still I am relieved to see you
safe again. My chief anxiety is about papa. I am afraid
there is something very troublesome in his business, and
that he is breaking down under the strain."</p>

<p>"I know that his business has been troubling him very
much of late," responded Clara, "for he told me so, and
any one could see that he is much disturbed; but how has
he shown it to-day? I didn't see him at breakfast, you
know."</p>

<p>"No, he hurried to his office, as he told me later, to get
some important mail. I didn't notice anything beyond his
usual nervous manner&mdash;that is, his recent manner, at
breakfast time, but about half an hour after you had gone
he returned in great haste and inquired for you. I told
him you had gone with Paul and another man who had
given you a clew, and that I couldn't tell when you would
return. He seemed very much disappointed, and walked
up and down the room several times. I asked him if he
had any news about Ivan. He answered abruptly: 'I think
so. I must see Clara.'"</p>

<p>Startled by hope and fear at once, Clara sank into a
chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Louise in dismay, "don't please
break down now, for that isn't all, and I am so afraid
you'll need all your strength to-day."</p>

<p>"I am strong," said Clara, resolutely, but it was all she
could do to keep her voice steady; "this day will see the
end one way or another, and I am prepared for it."</p>

<p>"I begged papa to tell me what he had heard, but he
refused to do so, almost roughly, too. 'Tell her to wait
when she comes in,' he said, and he went out again. He
came back at luncheon time looking dreadfully excited.
His first words were an inquiry for you. The perspiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
rolled down his face as he tried to be calm. He couldn't
eat or keep still. I tried to soothe him, but he wouldn't let
me. Then I insisted that he tell me what he had heard.
'I haven't heard anything,' he answered excitedly; 'who
said I had? I only surmise. I must see Clara.' We both
supposed you would come home to luncheon, and he
waited for you as long as his impatience would let him.
He went away about fifteen minutes ago, telling me again
to have you wait for him. I am dreadfully alarmed."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Clara in a low voice. She was beginning
to feel a sense of confusion, and she had to think
hard to convince herself that she had really left Paul on
guard at Bulfinch Place and Michael in the street near
the old tavern. It seemed to her essential that she should
be in both places, and here at home also. She had intended
to seek her uncle's assistance in any event, and now he
was vainly looking for her with some manner of important
and, it seemed likely, bad news.</p>

<p>"I am faint," she added after a moment; "perhaps I
can think better if I have a cup of tea."</p>

<p>Louise hastened to give the orders to the servant, and
a few minutes later Clara ate and drank. It was well
that she thought of luncheon, well that she could eat, for
her vital energies had been severely drawn on, and there
was much more ahead of her to do. After she had refreshed
herself she said:</p>

<p>"I cannot wait for uncle. I don't know what is the most
important thing to do, but I feel that I must not wait
here. I will send Michael, the cabman, back. Please see
that he has luncheon, and keep him here until uncle
returns. Then send him for me. He will know where to
find me, and I promise to come home at once unless&mdash;Well,
send him to me, and I will return if I can."</p>

<p>Louise was tearful at Clara's departure, but she did not
try to detain her. It would have done no good, and she
knew it.</p>

<p>When Clara found Mike faithfully on guard just where
she had left him, she told him her programme, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
together they hunted for a place from which she could
keep her eyes on the old tavern, unobserved by Poubalov,
should he return.</p>

<p>They found it in the sitting-room of a house across the
way, the mistress of which, a plain, practical woman who
knew the woes of economy, was not averse to renting
for a few hours the apartment she seldom had time to use,
and never on a Monday.</p>

<p>This done, Mike drove to Mr. Pembroke's and hitched
his horse at the gate, with its nose in a feed-bag. The
young man made short work of the luncheon Louise had
prepared for him, and then promptly fell asleep over the
book she gave him to while away time with.</p>

<p>No good end will be served by reviewing the lonely
hours of Clara's vigil. It was with her, as with Paul, a
monotonous period, far harder to endure, in some senses,
than the exciting and exacting experiences of the forenoon.</p>

<p>It will be enough, then, to say that when Mike came in
the edge of the evening to tell her that her uncle was at
home, she had seen no sign of Poubalov or Patterson,
or of life in the ancient tavern.</p>

<p>Reluctantly she quitted her post, because nothing had
happened, willingly because she hoped for definite information
of some kind from her uncle. The coupé was at
the door.</p>

<p>"Will you want me longer, miss?" asked Mike as she
came out, prepared to go home.</p>

<p>"I suppose you ought to go," answered Clara, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Mike, in the same manner; "me boss
will be wonderin' what's become of the rig."</p>

<p>The long day, spent so far as he could see to no purpose,
had tried him, and yet, had Clara said the word he would
have remained in one spot through the night. Clara did
not say it.</p>

<p>She, too, was fatigued, not more with the exertion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
first half of the day than with the tedious watching of
she second.</p>

<p>"You may drive me home," she said wearily; "and if
your employer will let you, you might come back in an
hour or two to see if I need you."</p>

<p>Mike, therefore, drove away, when he had left Clara at
Mr. Pembroke's gate.</p>

<p>She went up to the house, and Louise met her at the
door with a white, frightened face.</p>

<p>"Papa is worse than ever," she whispered; "go to him
at once. He is in the library."</p>

<p>Clara opened the door and went in.</p>

<p>Her uncle sat at the table, with his arms and head upon
it, and he did not look up until she touched him and spoke
to him.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, uncle dear," she said, "that I was not at
home when you wanted me."</p>

<p>He raised his head with a groan.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," he responded; "you could have
done nothing, as it has happened."</p>

<p>"Didn't you have some news for me, uncle? Tell me; I
can endure anything."</p>

<p>He tried to look at her, but a violent fit of trembling
seized him and he averted his eyes.</p>

<p>"I thought there was going to be news, good news," he
stammered, "but&mdash;&mdash;" and he shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have been disappointed, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Disappointed!" he repeated excitedly; "worse! All is
lost, Clara, lost! Oh! that wily Russian!"</p>

<p>"What Russian, uncle? In mercy's name, tell me!"</p>

<p>"Your man Poubalov! He is&mdash;&mdash;" Mr. Pembroke's
words stuck in his throat and he looked at Clara with
watery eyes.</p>

<p>"You have seen him then," she whispered faintly.</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke nodded.</p>

<p>"And you have nothing to tell me?"</p>

<p>Her uncle opened his lips, tried to speak, and failing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
grasped the table with both hands while his eyes fixed
themselves in a stare and his face grew livid.</p>

<p>Clara ran to the sideboard in the dining-room and
brought him a glass of brandy.</p>

<p>She poured a quantity down his throat till he gasped
with pain.</p>

<p>The spasm passed, but left him weak, well-nigh helpless,
and Clara summoned the servant to take him to his
room.</p>

<p>A neighboring physician was called in, and after half an
hour or so he reported that Mr. Pembroke was in no
immediate danger.</p>

<p>Clara wished to see him, not, however, to torment
him with questions, but the physician advised that he
be left alone, with merely a servant, or Louise at hand
to attend to his needs.</p>

<p>"I am pretty certain," added the doctor, "that your
presence would irritate him."</p>

<p>Clara withdrew to the drawing-room and tried to collect
her thoughts. She had not heard from Paul and it was
now eight o'clock. It could not be that nothing had happened
during the long afternoon. Something surely had
occurred, and that through Poubalov, to prostrate her
uncle&mdash;&mdash; Ah! she could not sit still. Her programme had
not been fully performed. She was useless here, in the
way, the doctor had said that plainly enough. The tavern
must be searched to-night, and if Paul were not there to
help, she must do without him.</p>

<p>She said nothing to Louise, or the servants. In the
kitchen she found a candle and a box of matches. There
and elsewhere about the house were keys of various
descriptions. She took every one she could lay her hands
on, and thus provided, set forth alone.</p>

<p>It was a very quiet, retired street, on which the tavern
stood. Once it had been a main road, but traffic had long
since been diverted into other channels. She saw nobody
as she approached the gloomy structure with its overhanging
porch, and few lights were in the windows of adjacent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
houses. Under the porch she paused a moment in the
effort to still the beating of her heart. Then, instead of
making any attempt to pass through the front door, she
went around to the driveway that Paul had described, and
came to an entrance at the very back of the tavern. She
placed a trembling hand upon the knob and sought to
insert a key in the lock&mdash;but the door was opening before
her! It was not only not locked, it had not been latched,
and the pressure of her hand had set it ajar.</p>

<p>With unsteady step and with her mind bewildered by
grewsome conjectures, Clara entered. She closed the door
behind her and lit the candle. Had Poubalov, then,
returned when she had weakly given up the watching, and
abducted Ivan a second time? What did her uncle's words
mean? "All is lost!" Was Ivan&mdash;&mdash; She did not permit
herself to frame the thought completely, but gathering all
her resolution set forth to accomplish her task. Not even
indulging in a useless regret that Paul was not with her,
she looked about the room in which she stood. It had once
been a kitchen, and a glance at it was enough. An open
door was before her and she passed through it.</p>

<p>This was evidently the dining-room, and several doors
were in view, only one of which was open. Feeling that
this indicated the course taken by Poubalov in carrying
Ivan out of the house from the room where he had been
confined, she pushed on, and passing through this door,
found herself in the front hall. There was a stairway at
her right hand, and doors at both right and left. Whither
should she go? The doors were closed and she chose the
stairs.</p>

<p>At the top were two corridors as well as the passage
leading to another flight of stairs. Haphazard she proceeded
along the corridor to the left. It was tortuous, like
all hotel passages, and the floor was broken here and there
by steps, now up, now down. She passed many doors, but
all were closed. At the very end were two doors, almost
side by side, and as she stood hesitant, her blood chilled
and her heart leaped to her throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Was that a groan that she had heard behind one of those
doors?</p>

<p>Utterly unable to move, she listened with painful intentness.
Yes&mdash;again it came, muffled, feeble, inarticulate,
but unmistakably the sound of a human voice. In her
agony of apprehension Clara found herself halting, from a
strange inability to decide which door to open.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">POUBALOV SUCCEEDS.</p>


<p>Her indecision was but momentary. Every nerve tingling
with apprehension, her arms straining to embrace
her lover and allay his suffering, she threw open the door
at her right hand. Dusty furniture, faded hangings confronted
her, nothing else. Aroused by the disappointment
to a fever of anxiety and energy, she laid her hand upon
the other door, and above the rattling of the knob she
heard again the faint moan. The door was locked, and it
merely creaked complainingly when she exerted all the
pressure she could bring to bear against it.</p>

<p>She must work quickly. Holding the candle parallel to
the floor, she allowed several drops of the melted tallow
to fall, and on them she fastened her tiny torch upright.
Then she applied her keys, one after the other, to the
lock. It was a commonplace lock, a boot-buttoner would
have worked it, and the most commonplace key in her
collection at last turned freely and shot back the bolt.
She threw the door open and rushed in, and as she passed,
her flying skirts whisked out the candle flame and she
was in darkness, but in the flashing glance she had had of
the room she had seen the figure of a man bound to a chair,
a cloth wound about his head and across his mouth.</p>

<p>Clara did not seek the prisoner in the darkness. All
impulse to rush forward and throw her arms about
him had vanished; in its place was an icy chill at the
heart and an infinite sob that lodged in her throat and
would not out. Hastily still but with nerveless limbs she
stooped and felt for the candle, and, having found it, she
again brought its wick to flickering life and raised it from
the floor. Standing then upon the threshold, one hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
clutching the jamb, she made certain that the fleeting
vision of surprise and disappointment was bitter and
amazing reality. The man bound upon the chair was old
Dexter.</p>

<p>He turned upon her his blinking eyes, rendered sightless
for the moment by the mild glare of the candle flame.
He could stir no other part of his body by so much as a
hair's breadth. A long rope was coiled many times about
him, binding his legs to the chair rungs, his arms to his
side, and his head to the back of the chair. A pitiful
groan gurgled again in his throat as Clara held up the
candle and looked at him.</p>

<p>She stood thus not longer than a second, and then, having
placed the candle in a cup that stood on the mantel,
she sought to loose him. That he was concerned in some
way with Ivan's disappearance she could not doubt, but
she allowed herself no thought or hesitation on that
account. His evident suffering appealed to her, and she
plied her fingers hard and fast to undo the rope. The
knot was at his back and it had not been drawn extremely
taut, the numerous coils in themselves being almost sufficient
to hold the prisoner in his place. Very shortly,
therefore, she had the free ends of the rope in hand, and
she unwound them from Dexter's arms, still standing
behind his back and working above his head. When
with his own hands he began to loose the coils from his
lower limbs, she untied the handkerchief that held the gag
in his mouth, and Dexter was free.</p>

<p>He arose trembling. His limbs were stiff with long constraint
and he steadied himself by grasping the back of the
chair and leaning upon it. Breathing heavily and muttering
unintelligible curses he turned slowly about and
peered into Clara's eyes.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he gasped, "it's you, is it!"</p>

<p>His eyes, till then glowing with the rage of a baffled
will, now flamed with ungovernable hate. Clara, all her
resolution gone, her very life seeming to depart from her,
yet stood ready to do what she could to help him, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
with a passionate shriek he suddenly extended his thin
quivering hands and seized her violently by the throat.
Taken by surprise, her nervous energy exhausted by the
long strain and its attendant disappointments, Clara
made but slight resistance. Dexter clutched her with the
desperate strength of a maniac and pushed her back
against the wall.</p>

<p>What with the noise they made in moving across the
floor, and Dexter's snarling curses, she did not hear the
sound of rapidly approaching steps along the corridor;
but just as the frenzied old man had pressed her against
the wall, and when it seemed as if his fingers would lock
inextricably upon her throat, Poubalov dashed into the
room, laid hold of Dexter, wrenched him away from her,
picked him up bodily, bore him screaming across the
chamber and threw him heavily upon a bed. Then he
placed his hand over the old man's mouth and looked
around. Clara was now held hard and fast by another
man, and although Poubalov's eyes glittered with a fierce
light, he made no effort to interfere. Paul Palovna
appeared in the doorway, his weary face glowing with joy
as he looked upon his friend restored at last to the arms
of her who loved him.</p>

<p>After a moment Strobel raised his head, and Clara, still
embracing him, followed his eyes with her own, almost
unbelieving that this meeting was reality. She turned her
gaze with Ivan's to where Poubalov sat on the bed forcibly
quieting the ravings of old Dexter.</p>

<p>"Miss Hilman," said the spy in his deepest tones, "you
have been the hardest adversary I ever encountered. Last
evening you gave me two alternatives of action. You
told me to take you to your lover, or you would
pursue me relentlessly. You have made it a desperately
hard task for me, but to some extent at least I have
succeeded in evading both alternatives, and have, instead,
brought your lover to you."</p>

<p>Clara turned her wondering eyes to Ivan's for confirmation
and explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is true, dearest," he said. "We owe my deliverance
to Poubalov, and without his efforts I shudder to think
what would have happened to me."</p>

<p>"Is it possible," asked Clara in a subdued voice, "that
you have really been trying to find Ivan all along?"</p>

<p>"Miss Hilman," replied Poubalov, "until this Monday
morning I did not know where Mr. Strobel was, and I had
not the least suspicion of the truth until late last Friday
night."</p>

<p>"Let me sit down," said Clara faintly, "I cannot grasp
it all. Tell me, Ivan."</p>

<p>Ivan had conducted her to the chair wherein she had
found Dexter a prisoner, and at her last words Poubalov
turned away his head with a bitter smile. Not even yet
would she trust him to speak the truth!</p>

<p>"We owe our separation," said Ivan, "to the villain who
lies there under Poubalov's hand and to him alone. To
Poubalov we owe the deliverance. This man Dexter, Clara,
is a money lender of the most outrageous type. Your
uncle, to tide over a business depression, borrowed nearly
a hundred thousand dollars from him. This debt was due
to Dexter two days after what was to have been our wedding.
I am telling you what Poubalov learned after his
suspicions were attracted in the right direction. Tell her,
my friend! You can do it better than I."</p>

<p>"Miss Hilman will not believe me," replied Poubalov.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I will!" cried Clara starting from the chair
impulsively as she realized the situation. She went to
the bed where the spy still sat with his hand over Dexter's
mouth, and held out her hand. "Won't you forgive
me?" she faltered; "I know I have cruelly misjudged
you."</p>

<p>Poubalov raised her hand to his lips and was about to
answer when Dexter, the pressure removed from his
mouth, scrambled to his knees, clinging to the Russian
for support, and screamed, "Pay me! pay me! you're not
married yet and you've got to pay me! I'll ruin Mat Pembroke!
Pay me! I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man choked, pawed with both palsied hands at
his collar and would have fallen from the bed if Poubalov
had not turned hastily from Clara and caught him. Clara
shrank away, not terrified but shocked at Dexter's appearance,
while Palovna hurried across the room to lend a
hand.</p>

<p>"He is dying!" exclaimed Clara faintly.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Hilman, not dying," responded Poubalov
quickly, "but he is a very sick man. Thanks, Paul
Palovna, but I can get on better with him alone. You may
go ahead of me, if you please, and try to find a physician&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I saw a doctor's sign near the street corner," interrupted
Palovna.</p>

<p>"Summon him at once, then," said Poubalov who was
bearing old Dexter as tenderly as a nurse might carry a
sick child; "I will await you at the door and," addressing
Clara, "be with you here in a moment if you would hear
the hidden history of your troubles."</p>

<p>"Better here, sweetheart," whispered Strobel, "here
where I passed my week of death than in any other
place!"</p>

<p>It was several minutes before Poubalov returned. He
carried Dexter not only to the door but through the street
to the physician's house where medical skill was promptly
applied with a view to restoring the miser's wreck of a
body to something like life. If Dexter's course had run
tranquilly he might, perhaps, have lingered like a noxious
weed, for a long time upon the earth, but after the complex
shocks of disappointment, imprisonment and fear,
he had thrown the total of his nervous and physical energies
into that mad attack upon Clara. There remained,
then, but the dregs of his vicious vitality, and these
sustained him less than the length of the night. He was
still alive but the end was plainly in sight when Poubalov
left him to rejoin the lovers.</p>

<p>"Miss Hilman," he said the moment he came in, "your
judgment of me has been marvellously correct. It is true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
that you have erred in detail and believed me deceiving
you when I was doing my utmost to put the truth before
you; but it is impossible for me to be straightforward.
Mr. Strobel has said that his deliverance is due to me; that
is true, but no credit is due me for generosity or nobility
of conduct. What I have done in the way of searching
for him and restoring him to liberty, has been done
entirely in accordance with my nature. My desire to
appear well in your eyes might lead me to vain reflections
on what my nature might have been if the circumstances
of my life had been other than they were, but past circumstances
cannot be changed and nothing can palliate the
fact that long practice as a detecter of stealthy criminals
has made me habitually devious in my methods."</p>

<p>"Mr. Poubalov," Clara began gently, but the Russian
would not let her utter the deprecating words that were
on her lips.</p>

<p>"I could not change my methods," he said, "and moreover,
there were circumstances connected with this matter
that made it impossible for me to take you fully into
my confidence. Don't you recall how I refused to answer,
or evaded your questions? I would not lie to you, and I
could not tell you the truth, for I was charged with a
message from the czar to Mr. Strobel and to none other
could I give it, and not to him unless I were satisfied of
certain things, which, until Litizki's attempt upon my
life were in doubt."</p>

<p>"You must have suffered keenly," said Clara softly;
"tell me all now if you can."</p>

<p>"His imperial majesty, whom God preserve," resumed
Poubalov, "saw fit to effect a complete restoration of the
estates of the Strobel family, which had been confiscated
on account of supposed treason, and to recall all the members
of the family from exile. There was but one doubt in
his august mind, and that related to your lover, Ivan. If
he were engaged in sending pernicious literature to Russia,
or in any other way fomenting the discontent that
affects some of our people, the decree of restoration could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
not issue. I came to America solely to discover what Ivan
Strobel was doing and thinking. I could not leave the
country until I had found him unless I chose to disregard
the wishes of my sovereign. Therefore, when he disappeared,
I bent every energy to finding him. It is the habit
of men like Litizki to invest me in their imaginations
with extraordinary if not superhuman powers, and it is a
part of my policy to encourage their delusion. But I am
only an ordinary man, Miss Hilman, and in your hands I
have proved to be as weak as the weakest."</p>

<p>He paused and looked somberly at the floor.</p>

<p>"I have been sadly puzzled by this case," he continued
after a moment without raising his eyes; "nothing ever
seemed so impenetrable a mystery. I was sincere in
thinking the Nihilists had had something to do with it.
After seeing you I was certain that no other woman could
have led Strobel away; but I went to New York for
much the same reason that you did, I suppose, hoping for
some clew. I had about given up the Nihilistic theory
when Litizki's assault and some inquiries I made shortly
after, set that at rest completely. When Billings called at
your house I determined to track him. Why not tell you
then about it? Ask yourself if you would have believed
me. You would have said that I was already in league
with Billings."</p>

<p>"I did think so," murmured Clara guiltily.</p>

<p>"And I presume you thought I was afraid to face him.
Yes? Then you see now that I had to operate alone. I
was hiding in the shrubbery when he left your house. It
was dark, but you lingered at the gate and so prevented
me from leaving my place of concealment until Billings
had got so far away that I could not find him. But I had
seen his face. I readily saw that Litizki was following me
that night and I purposely gave him a chase in order to
mask my real purpose.</p>

<p>"When we left the train in the Park Square Station
after our return from New York on Friday evening, I recognized
Billings among those upon the station platform. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
left you abruptly to follow him. He waited for the next
New York train which followed us in directly, for we
were late, you remember, and there met the wretch whom
you found imprisoned here. I will not enter into the
details of my all-night watching and inquiring, but will
confine myself to the results. First, to jump over several
steps, I found that Dexter was going to pack Billings off
to Europe, and I followed to the steamer, hoping for a
chance to speak with Billings, for I can usually worm or
frighten secrets from guilty men. Dexter stuck closely
to him, however, and I returned from a trip to Boston
Light having seen both Billings and Litizki in the steerage."</p>

<p>"Litizki!" exclaimed Clara.</p>

<p>"Yes. By tracking Dexter and employing my usual
methods, I got acquainted with his man, Patterson. It
was he who overcame Mr. Strobel in the closed carriage a
week ago to-day, and who left him there bound and stupefied
by a drug that he had forced down his throat while
he went through the Park Square Station to give color to
the theory that Dexter gave to the police that Strobel had
gone to New York. Dexter at first declared that he had
seen Strobel buy his ticket, but later he weakened on that
point, saying he might have been mistaken. He had said
enough for Detective Bowker, however, and the police
investigation was pursued half heartedly.</p>

<p>"Well, I looked up Dexter's affairs and I found that he
had a grip on Mr. Pembroke."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me my uncle was guilty of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Hilman," interrupted Poubalov, "Mr. Pembroke
had nothing to do with the abduction of Mr. Strobel.
Dexter is the one villain in the case, and although Mr.
Pembroke's conduct may be open to question in one respect,
criticism would be finical for I don't see how he
could have acted otherwise. I shall have to go back a long
way now, but I will be brief. Matthew Pembroke had a
brother, Charles, and a sister, Sophie. You, Miss Hilman,
are her daughter. You know, of course, the family difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and the occasion of it. Your mother married against
the wishes of your Uncle Charles, her elder brother and
her guardian, and when she was left a widow he declined
to help her. Your Uncle Matthew was kinder, and when
she died he took you into his own home. Charles was
apparently relentless to the end, and there was never any
communication between you and him; but when he died,
a short time ago, it was found that he had remembered
you in his will. Two days before the wedding day Mr.
Pembroke was notified that you were heiress to one
hundred thousand dollars if you were unmarried. The
will provided that in the event of your being a maiden,
the entire sum was to be held by Matthew Pembroke, and
administered by him in your interest. If you were married,
twenty-five thousand dollars was to be set aside for
you, and the balance was to go to educational institutions
specifically named.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pembroke was worrying about his obligation to
Dexter, which he could not meet, and in his fretting he
mentioned this to Dexter. He did not tell you at first,
because he feared you might think you ought to postpone
your wedding, and he did not regard such etiquette as
necessary. Without saying a word to Pembroke, this
wretch, Dexter, plotted and effected the abduction, thus
compelling you to remain a maiden. The bequest was
immediately available and he brought all possible pressure
to bear upon Mr. Pembroke to make use of it for wiping
out the debt. It was absolute ruin to him if he did
not. Mr. Pembroke suspected Dexter, but what could he
do? He had nothing but improbable conjecture to work
upon, and Dexter applied the screws mercilessly. They
went to New York to make arrangements for collecting the
inheritance. While there they were both in terror lest
you discover the truth, for once at least you saw them
with the man who could have revealed the financial secret
of the situation. You remember looking in at the hotel
entrance and seeing Dexter, your uncle and a third man
walking in the corridor? The third man was the executor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of your Uncle Charles' estate, and Dexter walked him out
of your sight as quickly as possible, lest troublesome
questions should be asked.</p>

<p>"It all came down to this, at last, that with your signature
to-day to a document that the executors of the estate
had prepared, and which you would have signed readily
at your uncle's request, the money would have been
turned over. The document came in the first mail, but
Dexter did not turn up, and Mr. Pembroke could not find
him. That was because, shortly after breakfast, I came
here and found the villain, at last, giving Strobel sufficient
nourishment to keep him alive. I bound him to the chair,
but didn't release Strobel at the moment. After a mental
struggle that I will not describe, I had determined to
take him to you, Miss Hilman, and I was too proud to
permit my plans to be balked. Moreover, I believed your
uncle guilty, and I was determined that everybody who
had been concerned in making you unhappy, should
suffer the most extreme tortures that I could inflict. I
had already bought and frightened Patterson. It was
through him that I discovered this place, a hotel Dexter
had seized for debt. After I had succeeded in eluding
your pursuit this morning, I attacked Mr. Pembroke. I
spent nearly the whole afternoon with him, and, to be
brief, I got the story from him and drove him to the
verge of insanity. He does not know yet what happened
to Strobel, although he is aware that he is safe.</p>

<p>"Having thus punished Mr. Pembroke, unjustly I will
admit, to some extent, I came here and took away Strobel.
He was very weak and suffering from the drug which
had frequently been administered to him with his food. I
am familiar with such matters, and I had in my room an
antidote. By your attempted pursuit of me you had prevented
me from going there to get it, so I had to take Strobel
with me to Bulfinch Place before restoring him to you.
We had a little scene at the lodging-house&mdash;&mdash;" Poubalov
paused here and glanced with a smile at Palovna.</p>

<p>"Is it any wonder, Alexander Poubalov?" cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Palovna, flushing; "I regarded you as our enemy, and
when I saw you with Strobel helpless in your possession,
my worst suspicions were confirmed. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You could have shot me with a clear conscience! I understand
and I understood then. You are a loyal friend,
Paul Palovna, and I owe you my life, not on this occasion,
perhaps, but at that other time&mdash;no matter! The
past is past and things are as they are! The short of it is,
Miss Hilman, that we satisfied Palovna that matters were
not as bad as they looked, and, as you see, he came along
with us. We went to Mr. Pembroke's. As you were not
there, we came directly here. And that, I think, is the
whole story."</p>

<p>Clara was weeping silently, and Ivan stood with his
arm around her. There was a moment of silence, and
then the party was disturbed by a hubbub in the hall
below. It proved to be nothing serious. Mike had been
ordered by his employer to return. He, too, had called at
Mr. Pembroke's and so found his way to the tavern, and
coming upon Patterson he had proceeded to thump him.
Poubalov separated the antagonists, and went back to the
chamber with the candle. The others stood under the
porch, for the front door had been opened by Patterson,
until he returned.</p>

<p>"If there is anything more to be said," he remarked,
"we'd better go to Mr. Pembroke's."</p>

<p>Poubalov did not remain long with the lovers whom he
had reunited. The supreme will of his imperial majesty,
he gravely declared, would not permit of his lingering a
moment after the accomplishment of his mission. It
would give him profound pleasure to report that Mr. Strobel
was too firmly attached to America to feel, much less
commit hostility to the empire of the czar. And so he
took his leave, Clara alone realizing that all well-meant
efforts to detain him were calculated to give him needless
pain.</p>

<p>Mr. Pembroke recovered rapidly under the relief occasioned
by the reappearance of Ivan, for whose absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
he felt vaguely accountable. With the death of Dexter the
business pressure was so far relieved that he could see his
way clear from the trouble, for all he had needed was the
time to turn in that the wretched miser would not grant.</p>

<p>But little time was allowed to elapse before the strange
interlude in Clara's wedding was brought to an end. A
few days after the ceremony Ivan read a brief cable dispatch
announcing the arrival of the Cephalonia at Queenstown.</p>

<p>"A steerage passenger," it said, "traveling as Nicolaievitch,
but known to be one Litizki, of Boston, jumped
from the rail and was drowned shortly after the steamer
sighted the Irish coast."</p>

<p>"Poor Litizki!" thought Ivan, "he died for us," and he
cut the item out to show to his wife if at some time she
should ask whether anything had been heard of the little
tailor.</p>

<p>The most interesting historic associations and the most striking and beautiful
scenery in the United States are linked together by the C. &amp; O. System, which traverses
Virginia, the first foothold of English settlers in America, where the Revolutionary
War was begun and ended, and where the great battles of the Civil War were fought;
crosses the Blue Ridge and Alleghany Mountains and the famous Shenandoah Valley,
reaches the celebrated Springs region of the Virginias, and lies through the canons of
New River, where the scenery is grand beyond description. It follows the banks of
the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers, and penetrates the famous Blue Grass region of Kentucky,
noted for producing the greatest race-horses of the world.</p>
